# 2.6 Notes

June 20th 2017

_In Update 2.6, play Grace, paladin of Gythia, improve your in-game comms with a new quick message system and get your hands on Vainglory’s hottest new skins. Get the full details below. _

## NEW HERO: GRACE

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1000x500_Grace_Final_Splash-1.jpg)

_When she’s not pummeling enemies into submission with her mace, Grace excels at keeping her teammates alive with holy shields and massive single-target heals. Pick up her talents in BRAWL game modes to unleash an even more powerful paladin._

_Grace will be unlockable with ICE only for the first seven days. Afterward, you will be able to unlock her with ICE or Glory._

## HERO ABILITIES

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grace_Ability_Icons_Perk_128x128.png)

**RETRIBUTION \(HEROIC PERK\)**

Grace chains her normal basic attack into a ground slam, dealing bonus weapon damage and slowing enemies in a wide area. If enemies are hit by the ground slam, her ability cooldowns are reduced.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grace_Ability_1_Icon_Benediction-.jpg)

**BENEDICTION \(A\)**

Grace dashes to her target, striking them with an empowered Retribution attack. Nearby allies instantly gain a directional holy shield that continually faces the target, while Grace gains a full holy shield that protects her from all sides. The holy shield reduces incoming damage that strikes the shield.

Upon learning this ability, Grace permanently reduces all damage she receives. This effect and the holy shield scale with crystal power.

On Overdrive, this skill is refreshed upon casting Divine Intervention.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grace_Ability_2_Icon_Holy_Nova.jpg)

**HOLY NOVA \(B\)**

After a short delay, Grace knocks enemies into the air and disables them for a short time. If the attack hits at least one enemy, Grace immediately recovers from the ability.

On Overdrive, Grace gains immunity to negative effects when casting this ability.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grace_Ability_3_Icon_Divine_Intervention.jpg)

**DIVINE INTERVENTION \(ULTIMATE\)**

Grace instantly surrounds herself and her target with a full holy shield and begins channeling after which Grace’s target receives a massive heal.

_As the end drew close, Reim climbed the highest peak in the Kalls, casting his last insults upon the Grangor, patting snow beasts and cave trolls on their heads in farewell. He settled on the summit and let the thin air lull him to sleep, ready to die in the oblivion of dreams._

## **MARKET CHANGES** {#quests}

**TALENT COINS REMOVED FROM MYSTERY CHESTS**

_While the response to talents has been quite positive overall, we did notice one consistent point of feedback: Players missed the old Mystery Chests. It’s clear that players want to be able to choose when to get talents and when to get skins and heroes. We heard you, so we’re removing talent coins from all Mystery Chests. This way, you can open Talent Chests when you want talents and open Mystery Chests when you want heroes and skins. Please keep your feedback coming. — Playoffbeard    
_

**‘HOLD-TO-CONFIRM’ ON BULK TALENT PURCHASES**

We’re making the button on bulk Talent Coin purchases from the Daily Pick 3 push-and-hold to ensure you don’t accidentally burn all your Glory by mistake.

## LIVE GAME IMPROVEMENTS

_When the year started, we laid out our vision and priorities for 2017, starting with improving our short BRAWL game modes. Now that talents has launched, it’s time to start delivering on our next focus area: Live Game Improvements \(a.k.a “Buttery Smooth”\)._

In Update 2.6, we’re focusing on player pain related to in-game communication.

**PRESET MESSAGES**

You’ll now have access to a variety of new quick messages that can be accessed by tapping on the new “message” ping, which is located where the “?” ping used to be. Encourage allies to buy defense items, purchase more vision, push to win and much more.

Like social and tactical pings, quick messages will restrict the amount of phrases that can be sent within a certain interval of time. As an extra ping-SPAM deterrent, time-sensitive communications like ‘GLHF!’ and ‘GG!’ can only be used during the opening or closing moments of each match.

**ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS**

We’ve all been in there: You — very politely of course — want to tell your captain to first-buy an Atlas Pauldron to deal with the enemy Krul … but you can’t. Or, perhaps you’re desperate for your teammate to grab a Crucible to block those Phinn Forced Accords. Maybe you’re just worried that the carry and the jungler are both building crystal and will be too easy to counterbuild. Whatever the scenario, the new item recommendation option will allow you to suggest _any_ item to a specific ally at anytime during a match.

**ABILITIES COOLDOWN TIMER**

You can now easily communicate ability cooldown times with the tap of an icon. You know what this means, right? You’re one step closer to coordinating those crazy wombo combos you’ve always dreamed of. It means that when you’re not ready for a teamfight because your ult’s on cooldown, you can let your team know!

All these comms additions are a direct response input from the Vainglory Community. We know that you were struggling to convey certain thoughts, and we hope these changes address those woes.

**QUESTS TRIUMPHANT RETURN**

That didn’t take long. We _maaay_ have made a mistake by removing the top and bottom quest slots, and you all were quick to express your disappointment. The good news? They’re back. Our commitment is that we will always pay attention to the voices in the player community, and when we need to course-correct, we will. We may have made a bad call, but we’ll always make it right.

## **SUMMER SEASON BEGINS** {#quests}

**WHAT’S A SOFT VISUAL SKILL TIER RESET?**

When you open the app for the first time during Summer season, you’ll notice that your visual skill tier has dropped by approximately one tier. Smaller reductions and in some cases increases apply to players whose skill tiers have decayed. This will give you room to climb in Summer season, and give you a chance to hopefully reach your highest tier ever.

Your highest skill tier achieved during each season will still be immortalized in your trophy cabinet.

Ranked will now also have a “decay floor” for players who take a break from the Halcyon Fold, meaning you won’t decay indefinitely. This should ensure that their sabbaticals don’t interfere with how they’re matched with other players upon return.

## **MATCHMAKING CHANGES** {#quests}

**HOW MATCHMAKING IS CHANGING IN 2.6 & BEYOND**  
In the the coming months, we’re making some of the biggest changes to matchmaking ever. Our commitment is to make Ranked play the fairest, most rewarding competitive experience possible. Here’s what’s in store:

* We are testing out our biggest change ever to our matchmaking algorithm starting in Update 2.6. We will observe the results and tune throughout the rest of the year.
* Anticipate fairer matches and shorter matchmaking times.
* Soon, we’ll reintroduce the “one tier” rule where players may only party queue with friends one tier above or below them in rank.

Matchmaking is very much a living and breathing entity that’s continuously adapting to your needs. We’re already testing more changes for beyond 2.6. Expect frequent tuning over the coming updates. We take the Ranked experience very seriously and are committed to “buttery smoothness” throughout. Collectively, all these changes should reduce perceived instances of mismatched games while maintaining the sense of progression and achievement that each new Vainglory season offers. We look forward to your feedback.

## **BLITZ CHANGES** {#quests}

The amount of damage and health that the Middle Sentry had made it far too difficult to contest it as an objective. —Zekent

* Middle Sentry has been slightly weakened
* Blitz now displays individual score contribution instead of KDA

## HERO BALANCE CHANGES {#herobalance}

**BARON**

**ROCKET LAUNCHER    
**_Baron was hitting a bit too hard so we gave him a smaller rocket launcher. —Zekent_

* Basic attack weapon damage down from 130% to 125%**NOTE:** **Baron’s balance changes, which were scheduled to go live in Update 2.6, have yet to be implemented. We’re exploring options for a quick fix.**

**FLICKER**

**MOONCLOAK    
**_While a particularly effective ability, the long cooldown gave Flicker’s opponents too long a reprieve from his aggression —Zekent_

* Cooldown down from 120-105-90 to 105-90-75 seconds

**GRUMPJAW**

**STUFFED    
**_Grumpjaw isn’t THAT hungry. A few snacks here and there are enough. —Zekent_

* Cooldown up from 60-50-40 to 70-60-50 seconds

**LIVING ARMOR**  
The rate at which this perk fell off made it a bit too difficult to take down Grumpjaw even while he wasn’t gaining stacks from basic attacks._    
_

* Delay for stack loss down from **1.0** to **0.7** seconds

**KESTREL**

**ADRENALINE    
**_Allowing a bit better energy management for Kestrel. As long as she stays in the fight, she should have a much easier time using her abilities. —Zekent_

* Duration up from 4 to 6 seconds

**GLIMMERSHOT    
**_A bug fixed on this ability in 2.5 had a much larger impact on Kestrel’s power than intended. We’re giving back some of the fluidity in her play style with this change. —Zekent_

* Reload time down from 3.3 to 2.7

**KRUL**

**STATS    
**_Some more early-game strength should help with Krul’s jungle clear and effectiveness in early skirmishes. —Zekent_

* Base weapon damage up from 69-139 to 77-147

**FROM HELL’S HEART    
** _This change gives Krul a few more opportunities to go for early ganks against his opponents along with a small reduction in cooldown come late game. —Zekent_

* Cooldown down from 80-65-50 to 65-55-45 seconds

**LANCE**

**GYTHIAN WALL    
**_The sheer amount of crowd control that Lance was able to dish out could be overwhelming to enemies caught by any of his abilities. —Zekent_

* Cooldown up from 9-8-7-6-5 to 9.0-8.5-8.0-7.5-7.0 seconds

**COMBAT ROLL    
**_Granting a bit more damage to the empowered basic attack after using this ability which should help Lance be a bit more of a damage threat on the battlefield. —Zekent_

* Damage up from 80-140-200 to 125-200-275
* No longer loses a basic attack target chosen during the roll

**SAMUEL**

**MALICE & VERDICT    
**This change should help Samuel stay out in the battlefield longer as long as he doesn’t burn his energy away with too many casts of Drifting Dark. —_Zekent_

* Energy cost down from 50-60-70-80-90 to 50-55-60-65-70

**VOX**

**STATS    
**_Bringing Vox’s attack speed in line with most other heroes. —Zekent_

* * Base attack speed down from 100-151% to 100-135%

## ITEM BALANCE CHANGES {#herobalance}

**POISONED SHIV**

The sheer amount of attack speed granted by this item made it much less a situational buy, but instead the most powerful option in most cases. _**—Zekent**_

* Attack speed down from **35%** to **30%**

## TALENTS CHANGES

Update 2.5 marked a major milestone for Vainglory: The arrival of talents, collectable hero upgrades that make short BRAWL game modes such as Blitz and Battle Royale even more mayhem-filled and fun. For the Talents Team, the work has just begun, with tweaks being made to reflect your feedback. See the first batch of changes below:
