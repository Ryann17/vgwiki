# 1.1.3 Notes

## UPDATE 1.1.3: EUROPE JOINS THE FOLD!

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28376%29.png)

Since the Apple keynote, we’ve received a steady stream of inquiries from players anywhere from Portugal to Moscow wondering when they get to play. Thankfully, that day is finally here. On behalf of the entire Super Evil team, let me say, “Welcome to Vainglory!” We can’t wait for you to jump into the Halcyon Fold and tell us what you think of the game and its heroes. And when you’re ready for detailed hero guides and other supplemental resources, they’re below.

> “If you encounter any laughably bad translations in-game, please let us know!”

Our existing players are used to these Update Notes as being the place to discover the new features, heroes and balance changes we’ve implemented. But this update and the next won’t be typical; they’re dedicated to opening up Vainglory to the rest of the world. Rest assured, more features and heroes are on the way, and I think you’ll be pretty excited about the stuff the team is cooking up.

Once you’ve poked around and played a few matches, be sure to drop into the forums with your feedback, suggestions and feature requests. We’re in there reading and interacting with players regularly, and your thoughts help shape our priorities for the work to come.

Lastly, thanks to all our early players from Europe such as HuNT and Elizabeth who have been translating articles and building regional Vainglory communities without any prompting from us. We’re so excited to open the floodgates to all the players in your parts of the world. _—PlayoffBeard_
