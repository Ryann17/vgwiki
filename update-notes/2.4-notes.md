## [Update 2.4: Reap Souls as Baptiste & Enjoy Double Glory Weekends!](https://www.vainglorygame.com/news/update-2-4-reap-souls-as-baptiste-enjoy-double-glory-weekends/)

April 24th 2017

_Update 2.4 introduces Baptiste, the soul-reaper, and announces Double Glory weekends all update long. Read on for new skins, new chests and all the changes coming April 26._

### NEW HERO: BAPTISTE

### [‘The Passing of the Gendarme’](http://www.vainglorygame.com/news/vainglory-lore-baptiste/)

_Baptiste dictates battle by striking fear into the heart of his enemies. Reaping the souls of his opponents, he both sustains himself and empowers his attacks and abilities. He commands his army of shades to either lock down unsuspecting victims or terrorize entire teams, forcing them to flee from him._

_Read on for Baptiste’s abilities …_

### HERO ABILITIES

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Baptiste_perk.png)

**Reap \(Heroic Perk\)**

Baptiste steals soul fragments through combat and is healed for each soul fragment acquired. Basic attacks and abilities generate soul fragments. Once Baptiste has collected four soul fragments he becomes empowered for four seconds, increasing the damage of his basic attacks and abilities. While empowered, Baptiste no longer generates additional soul fragments.

**Bad Mojo \(A\)**

Baptiste pulls a vial of liquid from his vest and throws it. The vial explodes upon reaching its target or when colliding with an enemy. Enemies near the explosion take damage and are slowed.

**Ordained \(B\)**

Baptiste ordains a target enemy, damaging them and creating an ethereal prison around them. If the ordained target leaves the area, they are stunned and take additional damage.

**Fearsome Shade \(Ultimate\)**

Baptiste summons waves of shade that terrorize enemies caught in their path. Enemies struck by the shade run from the source in fear and take damage each second.

### NEW HERO SKINS

### Four Double Glory Weekends are Coming! {#doubleglory}

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Double_Glory_Talents-1.jpg)

**GET READY WITH DOUBLE GLORY WEEKENDS!**

We want you to have as much Glory as possible when Talents hits, so we’re rolling out **four Double Glory Weekends **to stock up:

* Friday, April 28 – Sunday, April 30
* May 5-7
* May 12-14
* May 19-21

_All Double Glory weekends start at 5PM PDT on Friday and run for 48 hours, expiring each Sunday at 4:59PM PDT._

**WHAT ARE THESE ‘TALENTS’ YOU SPEAK OF?**

Talents is a new progression system coming soon to Vainglory, which is exclusive to BRAWL game modes such as Blitz and Battle Royale. You’ll be able to spend Glory to upgrade hero abilities, making them statistically better, more fun and often crazier. We’re doing things we’d never do in the “Classic” mode of Vainglory — and the result \(in internal playtests\) is some of the most entertaining and extreme matches of Vainglory we’ve ever played.

We can’t wait to get Talents into your hands … but in the meantime, play as much as possible during Double Glory Weekends so that you’re good to go when this big milestone hits.

### HERO BALANCE CHANGES

**ADAGIO**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2883%29.png)

**AGENT OF WRATH**

_Enemies afflicted by Adagio’s Arcane Fire were able to be taken down far too quickly. This small nudge should make carry Adagio less punishing. —Zekent_

* Arcane Fire Bonus down from **10-20-30-40-60 + 45%** crystal power to **5-15-25-35-55 + 40%** crystal power

**BARON**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28174%29.png)

**JUMP JETS**

_These changes are intended to make Baron’s gameplay feel much smoother without changing his intended power spikes. —Zekent_

* The double attack after using this ability is now automatic upon acquiring a target
* Cooldown reduction per basic attack down from **15%** to **12.5%**

**BLACKFEATHER**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28188%29.png)

**STATS**

_With the attack speed adjustments in Update 2.3, Blackfeather had a tough time applying his Heartthrob stacks to his foes. —Zekent_

* Attack speed up from **100-111%** to **100-122%**

**FLICKER**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28359%29.png)

**WILLOW WHISPER**

_These changes allow Flicker to more easily activate his perk and pressure his enemies. Be sure to pick up vision items when matched up against a Flicker! —Zekent_

* This perk will no longer time out while in brush
* Taking damage from lane minions no longer stops this perk

**MOONCLOAK**

_Reducing some of the frustration tied to this ability where the initial startup of the stealth would often be unintentionally canceled by a basic attack or ability. —Zekent_

* This ability will now attempt to re-stealth heroes affected while its duration is active
* Charge time up from **1.0** to **1.2**

**FORTRESS**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28376%29.png)

**TRUTH OF THE TOOTH**

_With the recent buffs to Fortress’ cooldowns, this ability was able to output far too much damage. —Zekent_

* Damage down from **40-80-120-160-240** to **20-60-100-140-220**

**LAW OF THE CLAW**

_Between the bleed stacks and the base damage of this ability, Fortress was able to contribute too easily in fights. This change should bring him back in line. —Zekent_

* Damage down from **100-150-200-250-300** to **70-115-160-205-250**

**KOSHKA**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28209%29.png)

**TWIRLY DEATH**

_While Koshka is meant to be an early game powerhouse, she was a bit too overwhelming after picking up a few items. —Zekent_

* Empowered attack crystal ratio down from **140%** to **120%**

**LYRA**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28139%29.png)

**PRINCIPLE ARCANUM**

_Lyra’s basic attacks were dealing a bit too much damage in the early game, forcing her opponents to play too passively. —Zekent_

* First Missile damage from **55-90** to **50-85**
* Second Missile damage from **65-175** to **60-170**

**IDRIS**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28294%29.png)

**DIVERGENT PATHS**

_These changes should grant Idris a few more item options to more readily activate his perk in addition to granting his Crystal path more consistent damage. —Zekent_

* Both weapon and crystal paths threshold down from **125** to **120**
* Crystal path basic attack crystal ratio up from **90%** to **100%**

**REIM**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28227%29.png)

**STATS**

_Reim has upgraded his walking stick and can now hobble around even faster! —Zekent_

* Base movement speed up from **3.1** to **3.2**

**RONA**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2862%29.png)

**INTO THE FRAY**

_Raging berserkers are best suited in the middle of fights. A small bump to Rona’s cooldown should keep her in there much more easily. —Zekent_

* Cooldown down from **14-13-12-11-10** to **13-12-11-10-9**

**SAW**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28514%29.png)

**SPIN UP**

_SAW’s attack speed was hit too much in the previous update, this should help bring him back into the limelight. —Zekent_

* Attack speed per stack up from **15%** to **18%**

**SKAARF**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28458%29.png)

**STATS**

_A bit more firepower for our favorite dragon should help him fare better in the early game. —Zekent_

* Raise base weapon from **74-148** to **80-154**

**FAN THE FLAMES**

_Some dragons just want to see the world burn. —Zekent_

* Damage per second increased from **5** to **10**

### ITEM BALANCE CHANGES

**Stormcrown**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28153%29.png)

**Stormguard Banner**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28440%29.png)
