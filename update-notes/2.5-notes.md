### QUEST INTERFACE CHANGES {#quests}

_We’re adjusting the front-of-app presentation to make it easier to participate and track progress in your reward chests._

**‘5-HERO CHEST’**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5Hero-Most.jpg)

* **The new “**[**5-Hero Chest**](https://youtu.be/lM8MF6WlAG8?t=68)**” replaces the first quest slot on the app front page**. Play five different heroes to earn talent coins for those specific heroes! Make progress faster upgrading talents for the heroes you enjoy most. 

**‘SLOT 2’ QUESTS**

* **The quests regularly featured in “Slot 2” have been your most popular**, both in terms of participation and player excitement. We are retaining these quests, which will continue to appear and function as you’ve come to expect.

**WIN REWARDS**

* ![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sinister7-All.jpg)

Some players might not even realize that **you are rewarded with bonus Glory for your First Win of the Day, Third Win of the Day and “Sinister Seven,”** which is achieved when you win a match seven days in a row**.** A new, prominent presentation of these win bonuses takes over “Slot 3” and will fill in as you make reward progress. With the introduction of talents, Glory has never been more important. We hope this helps ensure you don’t miss out on free daily rewards.

_As previously announced, if you have a quest in Slot 1 or Slot 3 in progress when Update 2.5 hits, you will **lose that progress. **Finish your quests while you still can!_

### QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS

**IMPROVED VISUAL CLARITY**

* Permanent turret-range radiuses in all game modes
* Consistent frost effects for slows
* Death timers display around the match clock \(don’t have to open Scoreboard\)
* Screen flashes for burst damage & stun effects \(turn on in Settings\)

**SCOREBOARD**

* Now displays item cooldowns \(including ally’s Fountain timing\)

**Ability Inputs**

* Pretargeted abilities such as Ringo’s Achilles Shot now pull up selection indicators when used without a target

**BASE SANCTUARY \(ALL MODES\) **

* Heal and energy recharge per second up from **8%** to **12%**
* Regeneration occurs in faster intervals for a buttery smooth experience

**BASE SANCTUARY \(STANDARD MODES\) **

* Now grants a small speed boost
* Boost is lost upon taking damage

**NEW ACADEMY VIDEOS**

Intermediate and Pro videos have hit the Academy! Whatever your skill level, check ’em out and improve your play!

**PURCHASE OPTIONS**

With the introduction of the new Talents progression system, Glory has become a much more precious commodity and you may run low from time to time. If there’s a talent coin you need in the Pick 3 or an upgrade just out of reach, you can now buy Glory with ICE to ensure you don’t miss out.

* Get more Glory with ICE

### DODGING AND LOW PRIORITY QUEUE CHANGES {#lpq}

**Dodge Changes**

Shortly after Update 2.4 rolled out, our team pushed a hotfix to address a recurring issue plaguing a wide range of players: match dodging \(leaving during or immediately after Hero Select\). Because dodging was hardly penalized — if at all — players adopted dodging as a tactic, abusing it to avoid any match with unfavorable conditions. This was so rampant that some players couldn’t get into a match, as someone else dodged every time. This dodging epidemic wasted players’ time, and it was especially frustrating after first waiting patiently in queue, only to then have their patience tested over and over as they suffered through each dodge.

To dramatically reduce the number of match dodges, we instituted a strict penalty, which continues to be in effect: **If you dodge a Ranked match, you will lose visual skill tier approximately equal to if you lost that match.**

Following the release of this hotfix, feedback from the Vainglory Community poured in, expressing that there was another important dimension to the problem. That leads us to …

**Low Priority Queue Changes    
**

Some players expressed concern with the dodge changes, saying that dodging was their only recourse to avoid blatant trolling behavior. And while Super Evil continues to believe that dodging is an act of trolling itself, we definitely understand that feeling of victimization when stuck with players perceived as trolls. As a **first** step to rectify this underlying issue, we are significantly increasing Low Priority Queue punishments for detected and player-reported trolling behavior.

For those unfamiliar, the LPQ is a “penalty box” where you must sit around and wait for the punishment clock to expire before you can play your next match … and you must complete a series of LPQ matches before you are released back into the regular queuing experience.

**The LPQ identifies bad behavior as:**

* Excessively declining matches
* Dodging
* Rude pinging
* Trolling / Intentional Losing
* Going AFK \(abandoning matches\)

Each of the aforementioned offenses is worth a varying punishment level; in some instances, it takes several infractions of the same type to earn a level. The more levels accumulated, the harsher the LPQ punishment.

Our hope is these LPQ changes will prevent the types of trolling behavior that cause players to feel the need to dodge — or cause players to have negative game experiences. This is not a silver bullet. It will not eliminate the issue. But we belief and hope it will substantially help, and we look forward to your feedback after release.

### BLITZ CHANGES

** BLITZ ONLY**

* Gold Miner renamed to Middle Sentry
  * Middle Sentry is now always visible
  * Upon the final blow, Middle Sentry no longer pays out gold
  * Killing Middle Sentry maintains 3-point reward
* Out-of-combat health and regen increased
* Sanctuary regen increased
* Personal Blitz Score will track your Blitz performance over time

### HERO BALANCE CHANGES {#herobalance}

**ARDAN**

**Julia’s Gift    
**_Ardan’s gear was due for a bit of a tune-up. This should make him far more effective at soaking up damage for his allies. —Zekent_

* Health gained up from **1%** to **1.5%**

**BAPTISTE**

**BAD MOJO    
**_With a few bumps to his crystal ratios, enemies need to be even more wary when Baptiste is empowered. —Zekent_

* Impact crystal ratio up from **90%** to **110%**
* Explosion crystal ratio up from **45%** to **55%**

**ORDAINED    
**This increase in range makes Baptiste a far more threatening hero to face off against. Mobile heroes beware… Baptiste will find you! _—Zekent_

* Range up from **5** to **6**

**GENERAL**

* Baptiste’s Fear effects have been updated

**CATHERINE**

**CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD    
**_A slight increase to the power of this perk makes Catherine a bit more durable later in the game if she has been diligently acquiring stacks. —Zekent_

* Armor/Shield granted per stack up from **1** to **2**

**GLAIVE**

**AFTERBURN    
**_While Glaive is meant to single out opponents, he was able to use this ability far too often, making him both incredibly hard to escape from and catch up to. —Zekent_

* Cooldown up from **22-20-18-16-10** to **22-20-18-16-12**

**GRUMPJAW**

**GENERAL **

* Grumpjaw now has a crystal recommended item path
* Grumpjaw’s Grumpy now dashes to the target location rather than behind it

**GWEN**

**BOOMSTICK    
**_This change makes Gwen a bit less oppressive in the late game where she could eviscerate targets with low defense. —Zekent_

* Weapon ratio down from **45%** to **35%**

**KESTREL**

**GLIMMERSHOT**  
_This increase to the energy cost will force Kestrel to be a bit more careful when firing off barrages of arrows. —Zekent_

* Energy cost up from **50** to **60**

**ONE SHOT ONE KILL**  
_We can’t have this cost less than Glimmershot now can we? —Zekent_

* Energy cost up from **50** to **60**

**LYRA**

**STATS    
**_Lyra’s early-game pressure was unparalleled with her high amounts of healing paired with her incredible attack range. While her healing is still high, she will put herself in harm’s way if she wants to harass her foes. —Zekent_

* Basic attack range down from **6.6** to **5.1**

**IMPERIAL SIGIL**  
_It’s back! Well… partially back! While the burst heal is incredibly potent, Lyra needs to make snappy decisions when trying to heal up her team. Leaving the sigil out longer is more healing overall, but sometimes a quick burst of health can save an ally in danger. —Zekent_

* New: When reactivated, will immediately consume the remaining duration to heal at **60% effectiveness**

**ARCANE PASSAGE**  
With the changes to this ability, Lyra can regain her lost attack range while increasing the distance at which she can change the landscape of a skirmish. _—Zekent_

* Range up from **9-10-11** to **9-11-13** meters
* New: Passively increases attack range by **1.0-1.5-2.0 meters**

**PETAL**

**BRAMBLEBOOM SEEDS    
**_While taking out Petal’s munions is still a viable strategy when it comes to playing against her, she is able to summon more far too quickly. This slight increase in cooldown will give her enemies more time to put pressure on her. —Zekent_

* Cooldown increased from **2.5** to **3** seconds

**SAW**

**STATS    
**_Bringing SAW’s defensive stats up to the standard of most other heroes. —Zekent_

* Armor and Shield up from **8-76** to **20-86**

**SPIN UP**  
_Getting rid of an often overlooked piece of SAW’s perk and granting it back to SAW’s base stats. —Zekent_

* Removed bonus Armor and Shield per stack

**SKAARF**

**GOOP    
**_This change makes it so that Skaarf can’t instantaneously burst down his enemies. Instead, proper placement of his Goop pool is needed to truly see his power. —Zekent_

* Ignite damage down from **80-120-160-200-240** to **40-60-80-100-120**
* Burn damage up from **60-90-120-150-180** to **60-100-140-180-220**

**TAKA**

**HOUSE KAMUHA    
**_A pair of sharpened blades for Taka! —Zekent_

* Weapon ratio up from **30%** to **35%**

**VOX**

**PULSE    
**_The slow on this ability made it a bit too difficult for melee heroes to keep up with Vox… but only a bit.—Zekent_

* Slow at center down from **20-22-24-26-30%** to **15-17-19-21-25%**

### ITEM BALANCE CHANGES

** ATLAS PAULDRON**

These changes will give weapon carries a bit of a reprieve while still keeping the majority of this item’s effect. _—Zekent_

* Cooldown up from **15** seconds to **20** seconds
* Duration down from **5** seconds to **4** seconds
* Attack speed reduction down from **65%** to **50%**

**CLOCKWORK**

While a worthy purchase when already at high crystal power, a lower cost means that purchasing it early for the other benefits can still be effective. _—Zekent_

* Total cost down from **2500** to **2250**
* Sell price down from **1250** to **1125**

**ECHO**

This item can create plenty of game-changing situations and a few slight adjustments should make it a much more powerful purchase. _—Zekent_

* Total cost down from **2500 **to **2200**
* Sell price up from **500** to **1100**
* Max energy up from **250** to **300**
* Base cooldown down from **30** to **25**seconds

**NULLWAVE GAUNTLET**

Slight improvements to this item mean that enemies stocking up on activatable items must be a bit more wary when you pick up one of these. _—Zekent_

* Range increased from **8** to **9**
* Cooldown down from **40** to **35** seconds

**SLUMBERING HUSK**

With a bit more cost effectiveness and uptime, this item should become slightly less niche. _—Zekent_

* Total cost up from **1600** to **1700**
* Sell price up from **800** to **850**
* Health up from **400** to **500**
* Cooldown down from **45** to **30** seconds

**BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

* Fixed a bug where Blackfeather could incorrectly deal TONS of damage if certain conditions were met
* Fixed a bug where Broken Myth would fall off at zero stacks
* Lance’s critical strike basic attack sound has been adjusted
* Baptiste’s Fearsome Shade hit box now more correctly matches the visuals

* Grumpjaw’s Grumpy now consistently damages surrounding targets upon reaching the destination
* Fixed a bug where Glimmershot reloaded faster than intended at low amounts of attack speed
* Fixed a bug where Kestrel and Lyra’s basic attacks would travel a bit faster than intended at low amounts of attack speed
