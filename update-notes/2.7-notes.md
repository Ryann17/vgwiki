### **TALENTS GLORY REFUNDS**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

**A CHANGE TO THE TALENTS ECONOMY **  
We made talents glory-based because we wanted it to be a progression system for everyone, but based on the feedback we’ve received, players are hitting a brick wall on progress, especially those of you playing free. We want everyone to make meaningful progress and to enjoy collecting upgrades so we modified talents’ economic model by drastically lowering the cost of leveling them up. Our hope is these juicy new price points make talents more accessible.

**CLAIM YOUR GLORY REFUND **  
If you got Talents before Update 2.7, we’re refunding you 100% of the difference between the old cost and the new, much-lower Glory cost. You’ll be notified of this deposit via pop-up message once you log in for the first time after Update 2.7 is live.

### **BLITZ CHANGES**

**BLITZ**

Blitz continues to evolve as we observe how people play and consider player feedback. This update, we focused on pushing players out of the lane and back into the jungle by making turrets harder to kill. We also beefed up the sentries to prevent a sneaky side Crystal Sentry camp strat that was creating a frustrating experience for players.

* Middle Crystal Sentry is no longer visible without vision 
* 25 second respawn time added to the side Crystal Sentries
* Turret health increased

### **USER INTERFACE UPDATES**

**QUESTS**

* Added Grace hero quests
* Removed “Play Casual” quests
* Hero-specific quests are now refresh after 12 hours, not 18

**Tap-and-hold Scoreboard**

Prefer to take a quick glance at the Scoreboard without the taps and distraction of pulling up — then closing — the screen? Now, you can toggle on a tap-and-hold for the Scoreboard so that it only appears for as long as your finger is on the Scoreboard button.

* Tap-and-Hold Scoreboard added
* Turn on this feature by checking the box in the Scoreboard screen itself. \(After selecting this once, the game will remember your preference.\)

**Hero Select \(Blitz, Casual and Non-draft Ranked\)**

* Now hides heroes you don’t own, so that it’s easier to contemplate and select your hero for each match.

**New Card Boxes**

Card buying used to be an odd process that involved multiple boxes to choose from and a jumble of cards inside. We worked to create a clear and enjoyable way for players to get good cards.

Moving forward, we’re consolidating card purchasing to one box to eliminate confusion over which box to open. Here’s how it works:

* Unlock 4 random cards
* 1 Rare or better card guaranteed
* Price: 399 Glory

### **BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

**QUALITY OF LIFE & PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS**

* Fixed a major frame rate issue impacting all BRAWL game modes
* Modified chat configurations to improve stability and added in significantly more chat instrumentation so that we can better identify, track, isolate and resolve any ongoing or future chat issues.
* Step-change improvement in Match Accept stability
* Made animations more efficient.
* Reduced network traffic.
* Reduced memory usage.

**LATENCY IMPROVEMENTS**

Through the use of new local servers, we’re improving latency in hotspots all over the world. These infrastructure improvements are now positively impacting 34% of players globally. Here are some of the highlights:

* Southeast Asia has experienced a 35% decrease in the number of lag spikes.
* In Australia, lag spikes were reduced by 15%.
* In Indonesia, we reduced average ping by 11% and improved ping consistency by 62% \(meaning far fewer wild fluctuations in ping\), with lag spikes reduced by 13%.
* In the Philippines, we reduced average ping by 6% and improved consistency by 32%, with lag spikes reduced by 24%.
* In India, we improved consistency by 20% and reduced lag spikes by 8%.
* In Cambodia, we reduced average ping by 19% and improved consistency by 32%, with lag spikes reduced by 55%.
* In Thailand, we reduced average ping by 8% and improved consistency by 35%, with lag spikes reduced by 23%.
* In Korea, we dropped the average ping by 15% from 72 milliseconds to 61ms, and we reduced ping fluctuations by 48%, with lag spikes reduced by 10%.
* In North America, we reduced lag spikes by 10%.
* In Europe, we reduced lag spikes by 4%.

The bottom line is the tech improvements we’ve been testing are working, so we’ll leverage these learnings to continue to improve ping and stability for players everywhere. _—PlayoffBeard_

**BUG FIXES**

* Fixed an issue that caused Samuel’s Malice & Verdict to not do damage and not show the particle effect \(but was showing the animation and going on cooldown\).
* Fixed a bug where Grumpjaw was able to instantaneously attack twice after activating Hangry.
* Fixed a bug that caused Gwen’s Skedaddle to not block Grumpjaw’s Grumpy skill.
* Fixed a bug where stealthed enemy heroes could be detected erroneously.
* Fixed a bug where Petal would occasionally lose her munions permanently. 
* Recalling now stops Skye’s forward barrage and also breaks the lock from Suri Strike.
* Fixed a bug that allowed Skye to quickly return to battle by regenerating with Suri Strike.
* Rapidly moving back and forth while locked on as Skye no longer occasionally causes her position to get out of sync with the server.
* Fixed a typo on Skye’s Target Lock so it properly indicates her extra 10% bonus damage when locked on.
* Fixed an issue that caused Idris to be locked onto the ground if stunned just before using his Shimmer Strike.
* Stopped Grace from latching onto recalling enemies.
* Modified the Recall sound to be on the same cooldown as any other spammable sound so that it can only be heard the first time it is used rather than every time someone uses it.
* Fixed a visual issue that caused Reflex Block’s particle effects to last longer than it should \(no change to the Reflex Block length or how it works\).
* Fixed an issue that could cause the wrong trophies to show when looking at other guilds.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the UI in guilds to go all wonky \(technical term\) when promoting/demoting/removing members.
* Fixed an issue that allowed Team leaders to start queue for next match even if other members were still looking at end-game results screen.

**TALENTS BUG FIXES**

* Fixed a bug that caused Rona’s MOAR Rage talent to provide double the weapon power bonuses.
* Fixed a bug where Grumpjaw’s Rampage talent was doing damage to things he walked over after using his Grumpy skill instead of \_during \_his Grumpy skill’s charge.
* Fixed an issue that could in rare instances cause a player’s talent to change mid-match.
* Fixed a text discrepancy on Kestrel’s Active Reload talent. It should now properly show base numbers of Damage 70% and Energy 40%.
* Fixed Phinn’s Phaster Talent text to more accurately reflect what it does.
