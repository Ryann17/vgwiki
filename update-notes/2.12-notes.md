### **INTRODUCING BLUEPRINTS:  VAINGLORY’S NEW SKINS SYSTEM**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

Update 2.12 introduces a brand-new skins-crafting system to Vainglory, delivering on one of the most-requested game features after 5V5. The new system is simpler, far easier to use and focuses players on a hunt for a single desirable collectable: skin “**blueprints**.”

### HOW THE NEW SYSTEM WORKS:

**Complete quests to find skin blueprints in your loot. Each skin has a unique blueprint.**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x500_Blueprints-Chest_212.jpg)

**Unlock the skin by spending your single blueprint and the required Essence.**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x500_Blueprints-Crafting_212.jpg)

**Crafting costs vary based on the skin’s type.** \(Crafting a Rare skin requires the blueprint + 1000 Essence; crafting an Epic skin requires the blueprint + 2500 Essence; crafting a Legendary skin requires the blueprint + 5000 Essence.\)

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x500_Blueprints_Lance_Crafting_212-1.jpg)

_That’s it!_

### WHY THE REVAMP

New and longtime players have consistently told us that the tiered, card-based skins system is too muddled, difficult to navigate and requires painfully repetitive behavior, like individually destroying hundreds of cards for Essence. In addition, the card system bogged down loot drops with undesirable commons and created UI clutter.

The revamp unifies two largely disconnected systems, clearing up all the related confusion.

### THE HUNT FOR BLUEPRINTS BEGINS!

In the new system, players can focus their attention on finding **blueprints** \(one for each skin\). Once the blueprint is discovered, all that’s needed is the Essence to finish crafting the skin. Essence is the same for all skins, so this common pool can be easily distributed however you want. And instead of scanning through a skin collection looking at “79/8” cards \(lel\) and doing a ton of mental math, you’ll know exactly where you stand at all times.

If you find a skin blueprint you already have, it will automatically convert into a bunch of Essence you can use toward crafting any skin. If you find a blueprint for a skin you’re not interested in, you can always destroy that blueprint for Essence to put toward a different skin.

To discover new blueprints, complete in-game quests. Every time you complete a quest, a blueprint might drop as chest loot.

In Update 2.12, in-game quests are the primary way to acquire blueprints, but we’re looking to introduce more ways to get blueprints over time, whether that’s rewards systems or special offers or something entirely new.

### BONUS BLUEPRINTS BASED ON SKIN PROGRESS

Do you have a skin in progress but won’t have time to finish it? We didn’t forget about you.

* If the Essence value of the non-common cards you own for a skin is at least 33% of the Essence needed to _craft_ the skin, we’ll gift you the blueprint for that skin automatically. \(**Basically, if you already have 33% of the progress for that skin, we’re giving you its blueprint when Update 2.12 launches.**\)
* All existing cards in your library will be automatically destroyed for Essence at their _full_ _crafting_ value.
* You will only be granted blueprints for skins currently craftable, but you will get Essence for **all **of the cards you had.
* For any cards for uncraftable skins and for Limited Edition and Special Edition skins, cards will be destroyed at the highest Essence value.

**EXAMPLE OF GRANDFATHERED SKIN PROGRESS**

_YumaRanken is hoping that in Update 2.12, she’ll get the Kandi Twirl Koshka \(Legendary\) blueprint. To get the “grandfathered” blueprint automatically, she needs cards worth at least 33% of the Essence required to craft the skin, which is 1,188 Essence._

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x500_Blueprints_Koshka_legacy_212.jpg)

_When YumaRanken looks at her Kandi Twirl Koshka \(L\) card collection today, she has a bunch of non-common cards worth 2,160 Essence, based on their crafting value. \(Rares craft at 30 Essence; Epics craft at 120 Essence; Legendaries craft at 360 Essence.\)_

_That’s more than enough to get the Blueprint automatically! _

**WHAT’D I GET?!**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blueprints.jpg)

If you want to check which blueprints you got when Update 2.12 hits, just head to your SKINS browser.

If you’re interested in all the nitty-gritty numbers for the new skins system, [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/vainglorygame/comments/7t9mv2/deep_dive_blueprints_skins_skin_crafting/).

### EXISTING CARD ART COLLECTIONS

_Wait … Did you just say you’re automatically destroying my card collection?!_

That’s correct. We’re removing all the cards from the game, and in doing so freeing up a ton of clutter and memory usage. But we recognize there are a lot of players who enjoyed collecting cards and admiring the card art. That’s why we are retaining the data of each player’s individual card collection. We intend for your personal card art library to return sometime in the future in a new, different form. It’s likely some ways away and it’s premature to talk about that right now, but we know how many of you feel and we’re all over this.

### SKIN RENAMING

Eliminating the three-tiered skins system necessitated breaking apart our existing tiered skins such as Catherine’s “Paragon” skin line. Now, instead of three different skins all named “Paragon Catherine” of different rarities, you’ll find “Queen’s Knight” Catherine, “Paragon” Catherine and “Serpent Mask” Catherine all individually listed in-game.

While the tiers are gone, we’ve introduced new skin “themes” across heroes for you to collect, including an “Ice” theme \(Glaive, Krul, Reim, Skaarf\), a “Churn” theme \(Phinn & Rona\) and two additions to the “School Days” theme \(Joule & Samuel, joining Taka, Lyra, Vox & Koshka\).

These themes are just to collect for fun; there’s no relationship you have to worry about for skin crafting. We’ll also take advantage of these skin themes to create sale bundles and special boxes.

### HIGHER RANDOMNESS; LOWER SKIN PRICES

While the new system is cleaner and simpler, it also means targeting a _specific_ skin to craft will be harder because of the randomness of blueprint loot. You can’t control which blueprint will drop, so if you have your heart set on a particular skin, you may want to more often purchase it with ICE.

Because of this, we’re reducing prices for the vast majority of skins, so your premium purchases will go much further. Actual prices vary depending on the skin. This is an especially good option if you don’t want to take the time to craft a skin or _must_ have one skin in particular.

The contents of Rare and Epic Mystery Chests may also change over time as our systems evolve.

### SPECIAL EDITION SKINS

Special Edition skins will not have blueprints in Update 2.12, although it’s possible this will change in the future. For now, the primary way to get Special Edition skins remains collecting and spending Opals and participating in special boxes and bundles.

### LIMITED EDITION SKINS

If you’re a Vainglory OG who has the original seven limited-edition skins, those are still sacred and will not be craftable. If you don’t have them already, there’s no way to get them.

If you’re a Golden Tickeholder, you’ll be [receiving the Limited Edition Golden Netherknight Lance skin](https://www.vainglorygame.com/news/look-ahead-what-to-expect-from-vainglory-in-january-and-february) in Update 2.12 as a gift. That LE skin is also _not_ craftable in the new system.

We’re confident this new skins-crafting system will be a better experience for new and dedicated players alike. Give it a try, and after you’ve used it enough to form an opinion, [tell us what you think](https://superevil.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005895505-Follow-us-on-Social-Media). With your help, we’ll refine and improve the system over time.![head\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Head_Bracket.png)

### **APP REFRESH:  A NEW LOOK **

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

### Visual Refresh

When we launched Vainglory, it was just a thin glimmer of what it is today in every way. However, one thing we lost along the way as we added a robust feature set was a clarity in visual message with our front-end experience. With Update 2.12, we are taking very firm steps aiming to reclaim some of the cleanliness we all miss from those days when the game was much simpler.

### Some structural changes to note

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x500_Stormqueen_FP_212.jpg)

You now get into a match via the PLAY menu, which you get by tapping the new giant Play button in the middle of the home screen. There are now only five big buttons on the main lefthand navigation. Elements that no longer are on the left now live in smaller icons along the top, which is also where you’ll now find a permanent home for your account info. \(Just tap on it to launch your profile.\)

### A brief note on the aesthetic changes

_Lively._ That’s about the last term I’d use to describe our interface previously — and yet it’s something I’ve wanted you to feel for a long time. In Update 2.12 and beyond, expect to see more energy, life and care invested in making your out-of-match experiences much more pleasant. This step marks the first in our journey to improve the look overall. It doesn’t end here.

### iPhone X

We didn’t want to push out a simple “app-stretch” and have a suboptimal experience for early adopters of the new iPhone, so we took a moment to build out the right tech to support it and make it a great experience. I’m pretty happy with the results. It feels really lovely to have the game fill out the gorgeous new screen.

### **FREE CAMERA:  FOLLOW THE ACTION ANYWHERE**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

New to Update 2.12, the Free Camera feature gives you complete control over what you see on the Halcyon Fold and Sovereign’s Rise. **That’s right: This new feature is available in both 3v3 and 5V5**.

Toggle it on or off in-game for a more advanced, involved way to play. Once you tap it, your camera will unlock, giving you free access to look anywhere on the battlefield and plot your next moves.

You can also use the new Free Camera to look out ahead of your current position to better anticipate enemies and incoming attacks — or to better see the enemy backline during a teamfight. It’s a feature that requires more coordination, but those who master it will find it highly rewarding.

* Free Cam will be available in all game modes, including 3v3 & 5V5
* Access the Free Cam by tapping the camera icon in the upper right \(next to zoom\)

### **SCOREBOARD: THE INFORMATION YOU NEED IN ONE SPOT**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

Alongside many other upgrades to the Vainglory interface, we’ve made some substantial changes to the in-game scoreboard to streamline as much relevant information to you as possible as well as now making it capable of supporting our new 5V5 gameplay. — Kraken

**NEW SCOREBOARD FEATURES**

**GAMEPLAY TAB**

* * * Tracks current net worth of each hero in the game
    * Tracks ultimate ability cooldowns on allied heroes
    * Creep \(minion\) score calculation updated to reflect the exact number of creatures killed instead of being based on gold bounties
    * Tracks team net worth

![head\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Head_Bracket.png)

### **IN-GAME COMMS:  STREAMLINING QUICK MESSAGES**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)Gone are the days where you must tap on two separate menus to access quick messages and pings: The things you need to communicate the most have been merged into one menu. On the battlefield, every second counts, and this change should help ensure that you’re not fumbling through comms during heated moments.

* Quick Messages and social pings added to one menu for easier in-game comms
* New quick messages added, including useful 5V5 messages
* Less effective quick messages removed

![head\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Head_Bracket.png)

### **ACCOUNT LEVEL CAP INCREASE:  MORE PROGRESS, MORE LOOT**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

Feel like you’ve been stuck at Level 30 forever? Even worse, do you have that weird half-full progress bar? Get ready to move forward. We’re adding 10 new account levels in Update 2.12, which will give you more rewards to play for.

* Account level cap increased from 30 to 40

![head\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Head_Bracket.png)

### **Vainglory 5V5:  SURRENDER UPDATE**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)“With the addition of two extra players per team in 5V5, each individual counts for less of the majority surrender vote. We’re interested to see if players prefer a faster, more lenient approach to surrendering, while also introducing a team-wide shared cooldown on calling a vote.” -s4v0r

* Requires 4 \(out of 5\) votes
* Votes can be started at 12:00 game time
* The team shares a surrender vote cooldown \(2 minutes\)
* Cooldown starts as soon as vote is called
* Vote remains up for 30 seconds until auto-fail

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

**GOLD BOUNTIES**

“We needed to slightly retune gold bounties so that players don’t hit full builds too early. These changes will also put more emphasis on hero kills, Gold Miner and turrets. We’ll keep a close eye on these changes and make future tweaks, if necessary.” —Sonata

### **HERO BALANCE CHANGES**

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

**RANGE AND MOVE SPEED INCREASES**

With the addition of more heroes in 5V5, large teamfights can feel a bit claustrophobic. To combat this we are increasing the basic attack range for most of our ranged heroes, in addition several ranged abilities are also receiving a range increase or area of effect increase. Melee heroes in general are receiving a base movement speed increase to balance out the range increases. — Doomnyr

**ADAGIO**

_“We’re updating Adagio’s range & move speed and increasing the range of the splash for Gift of Fire to compensate for more spread-out teamfights in 5V5.” — Doomnyr    
_

**STATS**

* Basic-attack range increased from **6.6** to **6.7**
* Base move speed increased from **3.2** to **3.3**

**GIFT OF FIRE**

* Radius increased from 5.0 to ~5.5.

**VERSE OF JUDGEMENT**

* Fortified health increased from **250/400/550** to **500/800/1100**

**ALPHA**

_“\_Alpha was having a tough time adjusting to 5V5. With the extra players, it was to easy to break her reboot. To address this but also prevent her from being overwhelming in 3v3, we’re making adjustments to her reboot health and reboot times. In addition, we have increased the amount of time she holds onto her stacks of Core Overload so she can move between jungle camps more easily without losing her stacks._” —Nivmett\_

**STATS**

* Move speed increased from **3.4** to **3.5**

**INFINITE REBOOT**

* Minimum and maximum reboot time changed to **3.5** sec
* Energy recharge ratio reduced from **20%** to **0%**
* Reboot health increased from **450-2250** to **500-2800**

**CORE CHARGE**

* Stack duration increased from **5.5** to **8.0**
* Healing per stack reduced from **9/10/11/12/14** to **8/9/10/11/13**

**ARDAN**

_“We wanted Ardan’s Vanguard and Blood for Blood to have more range for larger teamfights. To compensate, we increased its cooldown.” -—Doomnyr_

**VANGUARD**

* Range increased from **7/7/7/7/8.5** to **8/8/8/8/9**
* Cooldown increased from **13/13/13/13/13** to **17/16/15/14/13**

* Cooldown increased from **100/90/80** to **130/120/110**

**BAPTISTE**

_“While we are happy with the impact that Fearsome Shade had during battles, it was up too frequently. We upped its damage to compensate for the cooldown increase.” —- Doomnyr_

**FEARSOME SHADE**

* Cooldown increased from **80/65/50** to **100/85/70**
* Damage per second increased from **100/125/150** to **120/160/200**

**BARON**

_“Baron is amazing in 5V5, so we had to adjust his splash radius and damage. We also reduced the slow on Porcupine Mortar to lower its impact in large teamfights.” — Doomnyr_

**GENERAL**

* Base move speed increased from **2.8** to **2.9**

**ROCKET LAUNCHER**

**ION CANNON**

* Range is now global across the Halcyon Fold & Sovereign’s Rise!

**BLACKFEATHER**

\_“\_Blackfeather’s kit was immensely powerful in 5V5 playtesting. His ability to uncontestedly split push proved to be unhealthy for the game. So, we have removed the slow on his On Point as well as increased the cooldown on the charge time for his Rose Offensive.

In addition, due to the increased amount of heroes, he was stacking Breaking Point a bit to easily resulting in massive executes. This has proved to be overall an unhealthy ability for the game. So we have removed the weapon scaling on the execute and moved it to the initial impact of Feint of Heart.” —Nivmett

**FEINT OF HEART**

* Weapon power ratio increased from **0%** to **50%**
* Removed weapon power scaling from the execute damage

**ON POINT**

* Barrier health ratio reduced from **10%** to **5%**
* No longer slows targets hit

**ROSE OFFENSIVE**

* Cooldown increased from **40/35/30** to **60/55/50**

**CATHERINE**

_“Catherine is pretty incredible in 5V5. Her kit sports one of the most reliable stuns in the game as well as a large AoE silence that when combined with Echo can silence an entire five-person team for more than 5 seconds. It became more and more apparent in testing that this was too much. In addition, her Stormguard was proving to be a bit weak in the transition. These changes will reflect a bit more damage while she takes less.” —Nivmett

**GENERAL**

* Base move speed increased from **3.4** to **3.5**

**MERCILESS PURSUIT**

* Stun duration reduced from **1.0** to **0.7**

**CORE COLLAPSE**

* Range increased from **7.0** to **8.0**

**CHURNWALKER**

_“Churnwalker has proved himself to be a force in 3v3. In 5V5, his power was even greater with more opponents to chain. We have reduced his health gain and damage sharing. In addition, we have increased the projectile speed of Hook & Chain so it’s easier for players to land and doesn’t lock you in place for quite as long during a teamfight.” —Nivmett_

**FUTILITY OF LIFE**

* Healing reduced from **18%** to **12%**

**TRESPASS**

* Cooldown increased from **50/40/30** to **70/60/50**

**FLICKER**

_“Flicker’s Mooncloak is an amazing ability in 5V5 in that it is a global five-person stealth. This change will make it feel a bit more impacting while decreasing how often it is up.” —Nivmett_

**GENERAL**

* Move speed increased from **3.5** to **3.6**

**WILLOW WHISPER**

* Flicker will have true sight while stealthed

**MOONCLOAK**

* Wolves base health increased from **450/575/700** to **600/800/1000**

**GLAIVE**

_Glaive has been one of the harder heroes to balance in 5V5. His Afterburn provided ultimate level CC and ganks at a very early point of the game. We have decreased his early damage, slowing his jungle clear speed, so if he jungles he has a downside. We also decreased the power of Afterburn and increased the cooldown. — Nivmett    
_

**GENERAL**

* Basic attack range increased from **2.6** to **2.8**
* Move speed increased from **3.3** to **3.4**
* Weapon power reduced from **80** to **70**

* Now stuns at the start of the knockback instead of at the end
* Stun duration increased from **0.65** to **0.75**

**GRACE**

_“We have increased the range and duration of Benediction’s directional damage reduction. Not only will this aid reach all teammates, but it will also give them a bit of extra protection. We have also changed her empowered attack cone to match that of Benediction. This means it will be much easier to land the empowered hit. With this change, the damage early game needed to be decreased slightly.” —Nivmett_

**RETRIBUTION**

* Empowered basic attack now uses the same Benediction version
* Empowered bonus damage reduced from **20-108** to **10-109**
* Weapon ratio reduced from **20%** to **15%**

**BENEDICTION**

* Directional Holy Shield radius increased from **11.0** to **12.0**

**HOLY NOVA**

* Cooldown increased from **13/12/11/10/8** to **14/13/12/11/9**

**GRUMPJAW**

_“Grumpjaw has been a sad … monster? For a while. With 5V5, he is going to need some additional tools to help him. We have given him a stronger slow on Grumpy to help him stick and a lower cooldown on Hangry to allow him to feel powerful more often. Finally, Stuffed no longer spits out the target when stunned since more stuns happen each game in 5V5.”  
—Nivmett_

**GENERAL**

* Move speed increased from **3.4** to **3.5**

**GRUMPY**

* Slow strength increased from **55%** to **65%**

**HANGRY**

* Cooldown decreased from **9** to **8**

**STUFFED**

* No longers spits out his eaten victim when stunned or with any other crowd control

**GWEN**

_“So, Gwen has been an interesting hero in the past few updates. While her weapon path hasn’t seen a resurgence as much, her crystal path has become very viable. Because of the slow and range of her Buckshot, Gwen could harass from near-perfect safety and give the enemy team very little ability to respond._

_So, we have removed the base slow of her Buckshot and put it into weapon scaling. This way, it’s very clear weapon is more utility-oriented while crystal is more focused on long-range burst damage. We have also made some tuning for 5V5 involving the range of her basic attacks and Aces High. these should bring her in line with the other weapon carries.” —Nivmett_

**GENERAL**

* Basic-attack range increased from **5.3** to **6.2**

**BUCKSHOT**

* Slow strength reduced from **40/45/50/55/65%** to **0%**
* Slow strength now has a weapon ratio of **20%**
* Slow capped at **65%**

**ACES HIGH**

* Increase range from **12** to **18**
* Increase the projectile speed from **16** to **18**

**IDRIS**

_“So, Idris is finally coming back into light. His crystal path has been missing ever since Broken Myth had been changed. So, we gave him base crystal power on his ranged attacks once he unlocks his crystal path. To compensate, we have reduced his base crystal power but gave him a little extra power in other parts of his kit.” —Nivmett_

**GENERAL**

* Move speed increased from **3.2** to **3.4**
* Crystal path basic-attack bonus range increased from **3.6** to **3.8** \(making this a total of 6.2 basic attack range\)
* Crystal path basic attacks now have base damage of **50** and **3.0** per level, same as his base weapon power and weapon power scaling; the melee attack should not receive this base damage \(but will still have the crystal ratio bonus\)
* Crystal ratio on basic attack lowered from **100%** to **75%**

**CHAKRAM**

* Crystal ratio increased from **100%** to **110%**

**SHIMMER STRIKE**

* Cooldown increased from **100/75/50** to **100/80/60**
* Weapon ratio increased from **100%** to **150%**

**JOULE**

_“These changes on Joule are to help her fit into 5V5 more easily. Her crystal path will be able to ult more frequently but at the cost of a bit of damage. Her Rocket Leap has also received a slight increase in cooldown because of the amount of walls she can escape over in 5V5.” —Nivmett

_“Just a simple range update for a better fit into 5V5.”  
—Nivmett    
_

**STATS**

* Basic-attack range increased from **6.0** to **6.2**

**KOSHKA**

_“Koshka is one of the longest-serving heroes in the game. When she was first introduced, she used to actually give herself bonus defenses to help her to stay in a fight. While this was removed because it made her a bit too durable in 3v3, in 5V5 she had a major issue of exploding the moment she jumped into five people. We want assassins to try high-risk, high-reward plays. So, we have given her barrier generation on her Twirly Death that scales with the number of players hit. This will give her a bit more durability if she chooses to make a daring play while not scaling out of control in 3v3.” —Nivmett_

**STATS**

* Move speed increased from **3.25** to **3.4**

**POUNCY FUN**

* Energy cost decreased from **30/35/40/45/55** to **20/25/30/35/40**

**TWIRLY DEATH**

* Gains barrier per enemy heroes hit for 1 second
* Barrier strength is 20/35/50/65/95 with a 30% crystal ratio per hero hit.
* Energy cost decreased from **40/50/60/70/80** to **20/30/40/50/60**
* Base damage decreased from **80/120/160/200/280** to **70/105/140/175/245**

**KRUL**

_“This change will give a clever Krul the tools he needs to gank targets effectively in 5V5 — while not increasing his base move speed and making him inescapable. In addition, the small buff to his barrier will help him survive in 5V5 teamfights more easily.” —Nivmett_

**SHADOWS EMPOWER ME**

* Activation timer reduced from **1.5** to **1.0**
* Move speed increased from **2.0** to **2.5**

**DEADMANS RUSH**

**FROM HELL’S HEART**

* Stun duration reduced from **1.8/2.0/2.2** to **1.6/1.8/2.0**

**LANCE**

_“Lance has always been a high skill cap hero, and while he is fairly durable, he needed slight tuning for 5V5. We have lowered his damage but increased his health to make him last in a fight longer as well as increased the knockback distance on his Gythian Wall to hit those walls in the wider 5V5 lanes.” — Nivmett

**COMBAT ROLL**

* Empowered damage decreased from **150/250/350** to **100/150/200**

**LORELAI**

_“Just a simple range update and a slight tune down to her Waterwall availability. Since 5V5 fights go longer, she would often time be able to ult two \(maybe even three\) times in a single fight. This cooldown increase should ensure it doesn’t reach such extremes.” — Nivmett

**WATERWALL**

* * Cooldown increased from **60/45/30** to **80/65/50**

**LYRA**

_“Lyra has been one of the strongest captains for a long time. Her power level was accepted due to the nature of 3V3. Unfortunately, her kit is a bit too overwhelming in a 5V5 setting. We have had to tune down the strength of her heal and have changed how her B works. We have compensated by having the bulwark stay for longer, increasing the health scaling on her slow as well as giving her increased portal range and reduced cooldown on Arcane Passage.” —Nivmett    
_

**PRINCIPLE ARCANUM**

* * * Health scaling on slow increased from **0.01%** to **0.02%** bonus max health.

**IMPERIAL SIGIL**

    * Portal range increased from **9/11/13** to **11/13/15**

**OZO**

_“We started with some increased move speed to make our favorite monkey a bit stickier. We have also increased the speed of Bangarang so it feels much smoother. In addition, we lowered the cooldown to make it more appealing to max. —Nivmett

**STATS**

* * * Base move speed increased from **3.3** to **3.4**

**BANGARANG**

* * * Travel speed increased from **12** to **16**
    * Cooldown reduced from **70/55/40** to **70/50/30**

**PETAL**

_“Unfortunately, with the increased amount of players in 5V5, Petals poor munions would be destroyed instantly. This buff will increase their durability, allowing them to more easily stick around in a fight. We have also limited her mobility, which proved to be unhealthy in 5V5 but have given her a longer window of power after she uses it to compensate. —Nivmett

**REZA**

_“Reza’s mobility was a bit extreme in 5V5, especially with a cooldown build. This change will tune down his constant mobility slightly while making his dashes feel more impactful.” —Nivmett_

**TROUBLEMAKER**

* * * Cooldown increased from **15/14/13/12/10** to **20/19/18/17/15**
    * Dash range increased from **5** to **6**

**RINGO**

_“A simple change to give Ringo a higher high and lower low. He will now deal more damage while twirling but at the same time he will have to wait a little longer to do it again. Those seeking better cooldowns still have Spellsword available now. ” —Nivmett_

**TWIRLING SILVER**

* * * Cooldown increased from **9** to **12**
    * Base attack-speed bonus increased from **15/25/35/45/65%** to **30/40/50/60/80%**

**RONA**

_“Mobility has been an issue in 5V5 with so many walls to cross. Rona’s mobility proved to be a bit too problematic, so Into the Fray was tuned to be more 5V5 friendly. It will hit a bit harder, slow more and give her more fortified life for longer … at the cost of a higher cooldown. We tuned down her damages a bit due to the power of her Red Mist in 5V5.” — Nivmett_

**STATS**

* * * Base move speed increased from **3.3** to **3.4**

**INTO THE FRAY**

_“A simple range update.” —Nivmett_

**STATS**

* * * Basic-attack range increased from **6.0** to **6.3**

**SAW**

_“We started with the standard range increase on SAW but also made him slightly more mobile, so his stacks don’t impact him quite as hard as well give crystal SAW some of the power he lost in previous updates.” — Nivmett_

**STATS**

* * * Basic-attack range increased from **6.5** to **6.8**

**SPIN UP**

* * * Move speed penalty per stack decreased from **0.12** to **0.10**

**SUPPRESSING FIRE**

* * * Crystal ratio increased from **200%** to **220%**

**SKAARF**

_“Skaarf surprisingly enough had some major issues adjusting to 5V5. We decided to lean more heavily into his place as a siege and poke mage. So, after equalizing his spitfire so it’s much easier to land at early levels, we have decreased the cooldown, the damage slightly and increased the range of his Goop. This allows for greater zone control and sieging ability. Of course, with the spammability of Goop we needed to decrease the slow on it a bit.” — Nivmett_

**SPITFIRE**

* * * Projectile speed normalized from **9/9.5/10.0/10.5/11.**0 to **11.0**

**GOOP**

    * Base energy cost reduced from **75** to **50**

**SKYE**

_“Skye’s mobility proved to be pretty overwhelming not only in 3v3 but especially in 5V5. While we have increased the cooldown of her B, we have increased her basic-attack range and lock-on range. This way, Skye can use smart placement to keep herself alive, and the enemy team has counterplay if she misses a Forward barrage.”

**TAKA**

_“Much like Alpha, Taka needs his stacks to jungle. We have made it a littler easier to keep them and made it a bit easier to generate them. In addition, Taka was scaling a bit too well into the late game in 5V5, so we decreased his crystal ratios but increased his base damages. This will make him a little bit better in early/mid but will weaken as the late game comes around.” — Nivmett_

**HOUSE KAMUHA**

**VARYA**

_“Varya certainly took the Fold by storm. We have reduced the amount of damage her second arching attack deals to her primary and secondary targets. In addition, we have removed the weapon damage on her second attack due to this going against her intended playstyle. —Nivmett

**VOX**

_“By popular demand, I am returning to all of you crystal Vox. While his bounce damage has been reduced slightly, we have given back crystal power and crystal scaling on his basic attacks. In addition we have added bonus range on the bounces when you overdrive Pulse._

_To compensate for the lower base weapon power, we gave him a bit of power back in his A ratio. His range has been increased as well to fit in 5V5.” — Nivmett_

**STATS**

* * * Basic-attack range increased from **5.0** to **5.6**

_“This change is due to the decrease in cost and health on Travel boots and making boots a bit more accessible in a larger 5V5 map.”  
—Nivmett    
_

* * * Total cost decreased from **1900** to **1700**
    * Max health decreased from **300** to **250**

_“This change is due to the decrease in cost and health on Travel boots and making boots a bit more accessible in a larger 5V5 map.”  
—Nivmett    
_

* * * Total cost decreased from **2300** to **1700**
    * Max health decreased from **250** to **150**
    * Max energy decrease from **400** to **350**

_“With more time to farm up, crit builds became the golden path for all weapon carries due to how easy it was to reach the items needed. This change not only balances item-building but separates burst damage and consistent DPS more clearly.” — Nivmett_

* * * Crit damage decreased from **15%** to **8%**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/minion-candy.png)**MINION CANDY**  
_“Minion candy combined with the new captain minion proved to be a bit too strong at pushing turrets. We want candy to be a strategic choice depending on the situation. This will not make it such an easy always-buy purchase, especially in 5V5.” — Nivmett_

* * * Cost increased from **50** to **100**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/minions-foot.png)**MINION’S FOOT**  
_“This goes along with the other crit-item changes.” —Nivmett_

* * * Crit damage decreased from **10%** to **5%**

_“While Poisoned Shiv is a great item on a few characters in 3v3, it was just not keeping up with other weapon items in 5v5. This slight bump should bring it more in line with the other items in its tree.”  
—Nivmett_

* * * Weapon power increased from **30** to **40**
    * Hits required to apply Mortal Wounds reduced from **3** to **2**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tornado-trigger.png)**TORNADO TRIGGER**  
_While we did lower crit damage across the board, we have given the Tier 3 crit items higher base stats. This will make those items more effective in the early/mid-game but not scale as exponentially late game. — Nivmett_

* * * Critical-strike damage reduced from **15%** to **10%**
    * Attack speed increased from **40%** to **50%**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shiversteel.png)**SHIVERSTEEL**  
_“This item is definitely feeling much more viable with its change from last update. This is just a bit more love to put it at a point where more heroes aside from Krul would be willing to purchase it.” — Nivmett    
_

* * * Attack speed increased from **25%** to **30%**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/spellsword_item.png)**SPELLSWORD**  
_“While this item is finally seeing a little light, it is being abused in ways it was not intended such as stacking them. These changes will weaken those builds and increase their cost at the same time.” — Nivmett    
_

* * * Cost increased from **2600** to **2700**
    * Weapon damage reduced from **110** to **100**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Items_stormcrown-e1478210076913.png)**STORMCROWN**  
_“Stormcrown’s damage over time has been removed. Instead, it will function as it did in the past once more. In addition, while its damage and turret-taking potential is slightly lower than before, the item is also much cheaper.” — Nivmett_

* * * Passive changed to:  Stormguard: Basic attacks deal bonus true damage per second. Lowered effectiveness against heroes and structures. \(Does not stack with other Stormguard.\)
    * Damage to non-heroes increased from **40-140** to **50-160**
    * Cost decreased from **2200** to **2000**
    * Sell price reduced from **1100** to **1000**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stormguard-banner.png)**STORMGUARD BANNER**  
_“We decided to revert Stormguard Banner to its old form and make it much cheaper. We have weakened its power and tower-taking potential, but now junglers who want to clear faster or need the help can start with this item at Level 1. It’s a great option on a lot of crystal junglers in 5V5.” —Nivmett_

* * * Passive changed to:  Stormguard: Basic attacks deal bonus true damage per second. Lowered effectiveness against heroes and structures. \(Does not stack with other Stormguard.\)
    * Damage to non-heroes reduced from **20-70** to **10-60**
    * Damage to heroes reduced from **25%** to **15%**
    * Cost decreased from **850** to **600** \(Can now be taken at Level 1 for jungling.\)
    * Sell price reduced from **425** to **300**

  **BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

  ![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

* * * Vainglory is now fully optimized for iPhone X!
    * Koshka and Catherine guide new players through Vainglory’s basics
    * Koshka and Catherine unlocked for NEW players as Tutorial steps are completed. Players who completed the Tutorial prior to 2.12  do not qualify for this offer
    * Fixed bug where Joule’s Rocket Leap could occasionally fail to damage turrets
    * Fixed bug where Petal’s exploding seeds didn’t affect summons \(enemy Petal’s minions and enemy Fortress’s wolves\)
    * Fortress wolves will now attack enemy captured Kraken if all enemy heroes are dead \(previously, they would run past Kraken and attack enemy minions/turrets\).
    * Spellfire no longer affects Petal/Fortress summons
    * Turrets don’t attack neutral jungle monsters.
    * The capturing bar on Kraken is no longer inverted
    * Krul’s Spectral Smite no longer deals reduced damage to lane minions
    * Reim’s Frostguard perk no longer gives a fixed amount of fortified health from hitting Petal/Fortress summons
    * Krul’s Spectral Smite’s weakness no longer reduces damage dealt by the Crystal Sentry/Gold Miner.
    * The burst of damage from Skaarf’s burning Goop now deals 50% reduced damage to Epic Monsters
    * Celeste’s Solar Storm now only deals reduced damage to structures.  Previously, the ability stated it dealt reduced damage to non-heroes. The lead star actually did. The side stars only dealt reduced damage to structures.  Now, the ability states that it deals reduced damage only to structures, and both the lead and side stars follow this rule.
    * Fixed a bug where Skye’s Forward Barrage was able to critically strike
    * Reza’s Scorcher no longer passes through turrets \(it still damages them, but the projectile stops\).
    * The speed boost granted by Fortress’ Truth of the Tooth is no longer cancelled when taking damage from a hero, turret, or summon.
    * Fixed a bug where Kestrel’s Active Camo cooldown would be put on cooldown when taking damage from non-heroes
    * Crystal Sentry now aggros enemies within its vision range of 12 instead of aggroing within a larger box whenever its team had vision on you \(this should make Crystal Sentry behavior much more predictable\)
    * Jungle minion will now leash a little further
    * Mirror Mini-map setting:  

       If you would like your Mini-map position in 3v3 to be consistent with where it’s at in 5V5, you can go to your SETTINGS and flip it. Otherwise, your Mini-map will remain as is.
