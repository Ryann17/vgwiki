**BATTLE ROYALE IMPROVEMENTS**

### ‘CLOUD RAIDER VOX’ TIER III {#cloudraider}

![header\_gameplay\_changes\_new](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/header_gameplay_changes_new.png)

**SCOREBOARD**

_In Vainglory’s future, your first item purchased will be more meaningful, with more choices. This is an anticipatory change that makes it impossible to counterbuild until you’ve earned the right to know what your enemy bought. It also increases the importance of vision. —SurpriseBirthday_

* The Scoreboard will only update enemy item builds when you have vision of enemy heroes.
* As the match continues, you’ll need to regain vision to see how enemy item builds have progressed.

**KRAKEN**

_For too long Kraken has been a bit of a pushover in the later stages of the game. She has gained some ferocity to strike down silly heroes roaming around The Fold. —Zekent_

* Neutral Kraken late game damage up slightly

**MINION MINE**

_While this does allow games to be accelerated, there shouldn’t be a large downside to taking your opponent’s Minion Mine early in the match. —Zekent_

* Gold bounty is always **150** gold

### ![alpha](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/alpha.png)**ALPHA** {#alpha}

_These changes to Alpha accentuate her different styles of play. Crystal Alpha will be able to focus on using her combo to burst down enemies, while Weapon Alpha relies much more on sustained basic attacks and Core Charges. —Zekent_

**BASE STATS**

* Base weapon down from **83-138** to **83-125**
* Fixed a bug where Alpha could move while rebooting

**PRIME DIRECTIVE**

_Increasing the incentive for a Crystal Alpha to build up stacks of Core Charge to deal more damage with Prime Directive. —Zekent_

* Base damage crystal ratio up from **80%** to **90%**
* Damage per Core Charge stack crystal ratio up from **60%** to **90%**
* Fixed a bug where this ability would lock Alpha’s basic attack for longer than intended

**CORE CHARGE**

_The damage that Alpha was dealing to herself with Core Overload was making it far too difficult for her to properly take fights against her enemies early on. —Zekent_

**CORE OVERLOAD**

* The negative % health per second debuff has been removed
* Each stack now increases the health cost of Core Charge by **2.5%** per stack up to a maximum of **3** stacks
* Using Prime Directive still removes all negative stacks of Core Overload
* Base % health cost of this ability down from **10-10-10-10-0%** to **2.5%**
* Heal/stack changed from **4-6-8-10-12 + 1% weapon ratio** to **5-6-7-8-10 + 2% WR**
* Heal/stack reduced to **25%** against minions
* Base damage changed from **40-60-80-100-120 + 120% CR** to **20-35-50-65-80 + 80% CR**
* Damage/stack percent increase also applies to the weapon portion as well

**TERMINATION PROTOCOL**

_Alpha will no longer come to a complete stand-still. Instead, she will continue to move … very slowly. —Zekent_

* Minimum move speed up from **0%** to **30%**

### ![catherine](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/catherine.png)**CATHERINE** {#catherine}

**STORMGUARD**

_The reflected damage coming out from this ability is now considered buff damage \(similar to Hellfire Brew and Gift of Fire’s burn\). This means that it will now interact with various things differently — from Kestrel’s Active Camo to being less likely to accidentally steal a jungle camp from an ally while Ironguarding. —Zekent_

* Reflected damage is now considered buff damage

### ![celeste](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/celeste.png)**CELESTE** {#celeste}

**HELIOGENESIS**

_Allowing Celeste to pack a bit more power early on and properly utilize her novas late in the game. —Zekent_

* Cooldown changed from **3.0-2.6-2.2-1.8-1.4** to **2.8-2.4-2.0-1.6-1.2**

### ![fortress](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fortress.png)**FORTRESS** {#fortress}

* Base weapon damage down from **80-157** to **73-157**

**TRUTH OF THE TOOTH**

_Leaning a bit more into what Fortress is all about: helping his team close gaps to get on top of his enemies. Additionally cleaning up some inconsistent numbers on this ability. —Zekent_

* This ability is now a basic-attack reset
* Lifesteal down from **3** to **2-2-2-2-3** seconds
* Damage down from **60-120-180-240-360** to **60-120-180-240-300**
* Speed boost up from **1.7-1.8-1.9-2.0-2.5** to **2-2-2-2-3**
* Lunge duration up from **2** to **2-2-2-2-3** seconds

**LAW OF THE CLAW**

_Smoothing out the scaling on this ability in addition to a slight decrease in power. While using this ability for the upfront damage is great, it really shines when you are able to proc the bleed. —Zekent_

* Bleed proc changed from **12-13-14-15-20% + 6% CR** to **10-12-14-16-20% + 5% CR**

**ATTACK OF THE PACK**

_Prevents Fortress from gaining a pile of health from simply using his ultimate, along with reducing its power when paired with other heroes’ defensive buffs. —Zekent_

* Bonus health gained by Fortress changed from **250-450-650** to **300-425-550** fortified health \(**15-**second duration\)
* Wolves health down from **300-450-600** to **300-425-550**
* Fixed a bug where the wolves waited to find a new target when their target died.

### ![joule](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/joule.png)**JOULE** {#joule}

**HEAVY PLATING**

_Joule’s Heavy Plating perk now visually makes sense and applies to every instance of damage that is applied to her. However, this means that she now relies much more heavily on it and needs to be able to quickly readjust her positioning to prevent her from taking too much damage. —Zekent_

* Now applies directional defense to ALL damage types & sources.
* Shield down from **22-133** to **0-55** \(same as her armor\)
* Joule gains **55-150** armor and shield when facing the source of damage

### ![kestrel](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kestrel.png)**KESTREL** {#kestrel}

**GLIMMERSHOT**

_Kestrel was able to crush most foes with a handful of arrows regardless of the opposing item builds. These changes force her opponents to build properly against her or risk taking huge damage from well-aimed arrows. —Zekent_

* Weapon ratio up from **95-105-115-125-135%** to **100-110-120-130-140%**
* Armor pierce down from **10-10-10-10-20%** to **5-5-5-5-10%**

**ACTIVE CAMO**

_We wanted to give Crystal Kestrel a bit more of that slippery playstyle. She should now be able to more easily drop traps in key locations to surprise enemies. —Zekent_

* Stealth duration up from **1.2-1.2-1.2-1.2-2.0 + 2% CR** to **1.5-1.5-1.5-1.5-2.0 + 3% CR**

**ONE SHOT ONE KILL**

_Giving this ability a bit more consistent scaling so it doesn’t become an overwhelming power spike at each rank. —Zekent_

* Armor pierce changed from **0-20-40%** to **10-20-30%**

### ![ozo](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ozo.png)**OZO** {#ozoozoozo}

_Crystal Ozo was intended to be played as a tanky bruiser — not a burst assassin. His numbers have been adjusted to reflect that playstyle. While Ozo may take significant damage during Acrobounce, he will be able to quickly heal it back up with Three Ring Circus. —Zekent_

**THREE RING CIRCUS**

_By building Crystal, Ozo gains significantly more health when hitting heroes with this ability. —Zekent_

* Energy cost of this ability down from **50-60-70-80-90** to **50-55-60-65-75**
* Crystal ratio on 1st/2nd/3rd hit changed from **30/60/120%** to **50/75/50%**
* Heal per hero hit crystal ratio up from 20% CR to 25% CR

**ACROBOUNCE**

_The base damage of this ability has been increased and the crystal ratio has been decreased to accommodate for more of a bruiser build. However, building Crystal will still allow Ozo to increase the burst that he is able to dish out. —Zekent_

* Bounce damage changed from **50-80-110-140-200 + 120% CR** to **60-120-180-240-300 + 50% CR**
* Final damage changed from **50-80-110-140-200 + 120% CR** to **80-160-240-320-400 + 50% CR**
* Additional damage per bounce down from **25-40-55-70-100 + 60% CR** to **10-20-30-40-50 + 50% CR**

**BANGARANG**

_Ozo will now be able to cover distances much more quickly to catch unsuspecting foes before they manage to Reflex Block or outrun it. —Zekent_

* Speed of this ability has been increased from **9** to **12**
* Roll duration down from **1.2** to **1** second

### ![petal](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/petal.png)**PETAL** {#petal}

**TRAMPOLINE**

_Giving Petal a bit more reason to put points in Trampoline over her other abilities. —Zekent_

* Crystal amp up from **15-20-25-30-35%** to **15-20-25-30-40%**
* Weapon amp up from **8-12-16-20-24%** to **10-15-20-25-30%**

**SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION**

_While this ability is impactful, it was difficult for Petal to justify taking extra points in this ability. Now, there will be a much more sizable increase in health with each rank. —Zekent_

* Heal changed from **70-90-110 + 25% CR** to **60-100-140 + 20% CR**

### ![reim](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/reim.png)**REIM** {#reim}

**BASE STATS**

* Armor and shield up from **25-47** to **30-52**

**FROSTGUARD**

_Reim is very good against melee enemies. Maybe a bit too good. —Zekent_

* Fortified health gain from basic attacks down from **50%** to **25%**
* Damage over time crystal ratio down from **125%** to **90%**
* Damage over time base damage down from **20-54** to **15-54**

**WINTER SPIRE**

_Relieving a bit of the early-game punishment Reim is able to dish out along with reducing his tankiness. Not being able to dodge the second instance of damage on Winter Spire will be a bit less punishing. —Zekent_

* Second-hit damage changed from **120-160-200-240-280** to **100-145-190-235-280**

**CHILL WINDS**

Reim should be using Chill Winds as a utility skill to set himself up for a clean combination of skills. We’re removing base damage from this ability to ensure his enemies live to see the combo.

* Damage changed from **75-125-175-225-325** to **80-120-160-200-280**
* Damage to minions up from **75-87-99-111-135** to **80-95-110-125-140**

**VALKYRIE**

_Far too powerful in mid/late-game fights. Valkyrie comboed with Winter Spire wiped whole teams. This is meant to be more of an engage tool with some damage since Reim can easily follow this up with Winter Spire, which does the bulk of his damage. —Zekent_

* Damage at Valkyrie’s center down from **360-540-720 + 160% CR** to **250-375-500 + 125% CR**

### ![skaarf](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/skaarf.png)**SKAARF** {#skaarf}

**SPITFIRE**

_A bit less damage from Spitfire to dampen long-range siege action. Additionally, our favorite little dragon has been munching on minions far too easily. —Zekent_

* Damage down from **75-125-175-225-325** to **75-120-165-210-300**
* Damage to minions crystal ratio changed from **70%** to **50%**

**GOOP**

_Skaarf now needs to combo Spitfire with Goop for maximum damage. However, this puts him in a bit more danger. The combined changes of Spitfire and Goop make it so that Spitfire itself will do less damage \(it still packs a punch when building significant crystal power\). However, at level 4, the Spitfire + Goop combo will do more damage than in 1.16. At level 5, Goop does a bit less than in 1.16, but it can be comboed more often, making it a more effective tool than Dragon’s Breath when actually kiting. —Zekent_

* Ignite damage changed from **40-65-90-115-290 + 65% CR** to **50-80-110-140-200 + 70% CR**
* Damage per second changed from **25-35-45-55-115 + 110% CR** to **25-40-55-70-100 + 100% CR**

### ![skye](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/skye.png)**SKYE** {#skye}

_Skye needs to properly utilize her mobility and kite her targets as opposed to just dashing in and exploding them. —Zekent_

**FORWARD BARRAGE**

* Lock-on damage bonus crystal ratio down from **18%** to **15%**

### ![vox](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/vox.png)**VOX** {#vox}

**SONIC ZOOM**

_Vox was able to throw out an extra basic attack, which was dramatically increasing the damage he could deal with a single Sonic Zoom. This has been fixed. —Zekent_

* Fixed a bug where Vox would sometimes throw out an extra basic attack if he used this ability near a target affected by Resonance.

**WAIT FOR IT…**

_Allowing Vox’s opponents a bit more chance of counterplay. —Zekent_

* Silence moved to the second shockwave.

![header\_item\_changes\_new](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/header_item_changes_new1-1024x227.png)

**RECOMMENDED ITEMS**

_We decided to revamp our Recommended Items to give players a more in-depth understanding of a hero’s kit. Instead of simply recommending full item builds, we have really spent time to break it down to each level. This means that you will be able to feel the hero development as you level up and ultimately lead to understanding when to buy items efficiently. —ROAM_

* All recommended items have been updated

**FLARE GUN**

_While they may look flashy, Flare Guns were moving a bit too slowly and have been upgraded. —Zekent_

* Projectile speed increased

**FOUNTAIN OF RENEWAL**

_The slow projectile speed made Fountain a bit too difficult to properly time for clutch saves. This speed boost will help it feel much snappier and more effective. —Zekent_

* Projectile speed increased

**LIFESPRING**

_Historically, Lifespring was able to keep you a bit too healthy in the jungle. While you will now heal up much more quickly at low health, it won’t top you off quite as easily. —SurpriseBirthday_

* New Passive: After being out of combat with enemy heroes for **5** seconds, regenerate **2.5%** of your **missing**health per second.

**BREAKING POINT**

_We’re returning the weapon power granted by its build components to keep you moving in the right direction. —Zekent_

* Base weapon power up from **30** to **50**

_Update 1.17 is a historic moment for the game & community, as we introduce the first-ever new public queue game mode. Jump into Battle Royale now and have some crazy fun 10 minutes at a time!_
