### VAINGLORY 5V5 HIGHLIGHTS:

_If you don’t have time to read all the details below, here’s just a taste of what 5V5 delivers:_

#### **BREATHTAKING MAP & DRAGONS!**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1920x1080_dragon_varya.png)

Step onto Sovereign’s Rise, a brand-new **3-lane map** featuring two terrifying dragons: **Blackclaw** and **Ghostwing**, the Storm Queen’s prized pets. Capture them for game-altering effects.

Sovereign’s Rise also features **true line-of-sight Fog of War**, shrouding the map in mystery and danger. Understanding what you can see in Vainglory is much easier … and walking into what you can’t see is that much more harrowing.

### **THE VAIN FIGHTS BACK!**

Beware: The enemy Vain crystal doesn’t take intruders lightly, firing **Halcyon Missiles** and stunning **Rupture Cascades **in its own defense. Combo your own hero’s abilities with the Vain crystal’s attack for unavoidably awesome damage. Take out enemy **Armories** to weaken their Vain’s defenses.

### **ORB GUARDIANS**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1920x1080_map_strategies.jpg)

### **ALL-NEW 5V5 STRATEGIES**

In Vainglory 5V5, you don’t need to be the most mechanically skilled player to succeed. With [3 lanes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=babq23bixMw), 10 heroes an expansive jungle, more objectives and completely free camera controls, there’s many more opportunities to **outthink your opponents** en route to victory. “Macro-strategies” such as **split-pushing**, **wave manipulation** and **jungle rotations**are powerful tools to victory — and if you want to soak up all that strategic knowledge, head to the **Vainglory Academy** in-game and check out some of the amazing Vainglory **Community content creators** making Vainglory 5V5 videos. We’ll feature community videos frequently in-game in the days and weeks ahead.

### **5V5 HERO OPTIMIZATIONS**

Many **heroes move faster** to cover vast territory, are **more durable** to survive 10-hero teamfights and ultimates like Celeste’s Solar Storm and Baron’s Ion Cannon have **extended ranges** to cover the full Sovereign’s Rise map. Fortress, for example, now has 5 wolves during Attack of the Pack, one for each enemy hero in 5V5.

### **E.V.I.L. ENGINE OPTIMIZATIONS**

Experience the smoothest Vainglory gameplay experience yet, running at **120 frames per second** on supported devices and with unparalleled** control accuracy** and **responsiveness**.

### **ALL-NEW 5V5 MUSIC**

Vainglory is excited to announce a brand-new 5V5 score by renowned video game composer Joris de Man. Best known for his music for the Killzone franchise and Horizon Zero Dawn, Joris was just won the 2017 Game Music Award for Outstanding Artist – Western Composer. Vainglory 5V5 features an adaptive music system that unveils the score based on how you play. The music during early game is different from the music during an epic dragon fight, and so on. We hope this incredible new score makes your Vainglory 5V5 experience that much more rich and immersive.

Keep an eye on the new “Today in Vainglory” popup in-game for announcements and previews as we continue this 5V5 journey together with the Vainglory Community.

#### **HERO BALANCE CHANGES**

[Update 3.0 \(Sovereign’s Rise\): Hero & Item Balance](https://www.vainglorygame.com/news/update-3-0-sovereigns-rise-hero-item-balance)

## THE VAINGLORY 5V5 ENCYCLOPEDIA

_Below you’ll find details on all the creatures, structures and powers found on Sovereign’s Rise. Spreadsheet and theorycraft to your heart’s content. …_

### **EXPERIENCE**

_“With more heroes on a team, we had to make a few additions to how much experience was granted when more than three heroes were sharing the pot. Keeping in line with Halcyon Fold, the hero to get the last hit will get the most out of the kill.” —Zekent_

* Players generate 0.6 experience per second starting at 0:45

Experience share is \(Last-hitter/Other\):

* 1 player = 100%
* 2 players = 85/75%
* 3 players = 60/50/50%
* 4 players = 46/38/38/38%
* 5 players = 36/31/31/31/31%

If killed by a non-hero, experience is distributed evenly among all nearby heroes:

* 100% if one hero
* 160% if more than one

Experience needed to gain a level:

* 90 + 8 for each additional level

### SURRENDER

_“With the addition of two extra players per team in 5V5, each individual counts for less of the majority surrender vote. We’re interested to see if players prefer a faster, more lenient approach to surrendering, while also introducing a team-wide shared cooldown on calling a vote.” —s4v0r_

* Requires 4 \(out of 5\) votes
* Votes can be started at 12:00 game time
* The team shares a surrender vote cooldown \(2 minutes\) 

### THE JUNGLE

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/9qMe7pSQwsE\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Sovereign\'s Rise - Blackclaw Rush\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9qMe7pSQwsE/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qMe7pSQwsE?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qMe7pSQwsE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

**RIVER MOVE SPEED BUFF**

_“With river granting move speed from the middle toward the side lanes, there is a higher incentive to put more forces in the center of the map to more easily rotate and assist allies. —Zekent_

* Heroes moving with the current of the river are granted 1.2 move speed when not in combat
* Not in combat is defined as not dealing or receiving damage within 4 seconds

**RIVER SHOPS**

_“With two shops available out on the Rise, you don’t have to recall often to base. It also becomes possible to catch enemies unaware while they look for a few quick purchases.” —Zekent_

* River shops spawn at 5:00 and contain everything that the base shop contains

#### JUNGLE BEHAVIOR

_“Monsters in the jungle will now exhibit more consistent behavior and also regenerate small amounts of health if attacked from out of their range.” —Zekent_

* Jungle monsters will attempt to attack the nearest target to them
* If no targets are found within their aggro radius, the jungle/boss monster will walk back toward its spawn location and heal for 2.5% \(1.25% if a mythic monster\) of its health per second
* If the jungle/boss monster reaches its spawn location and idles, it will heal for 10% \(5% if a mythic creature\) of its health per second

### MONSTER SCALING

_“Monsters will periodically become stronger as the game progresses while capping out after awhile. Early game camps should feel fairly durable while being easily taken out come mid- to late-game.” —Zekent_

These camps’ level will always be the current game time minute divided by two plus one rounded down. For example, if the game is at 4:05, all camps will be level \(4 / 2\) + 1 = 3. Camps cap out at level 12. \(Yay, maths.\)

### MYTHIC CREATURES

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/CStMCFoqc4M\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Sovereign\'s Rise - Blackclaw\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CStMCFoqc4M/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CStMCFoqc4M?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CStMCFoqc4M?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

#### **GHOSTWING**

#### **GOLDOAK**

_“You don’t see the toad? It’s there. I swear!” —PlayoffBeard_

_“In terms of gold, this is the most valuable camp, but also the most well protected. If you manage to sneak into your enemies’ jungle and take it for yourself, it is a serious boon in gold.

### **RUPTURE CASCADE**

_“With the power to completely change the course of a fight, defending alongside this ability can allow a team pressured into their base to mount a heroic comeback. While fairly simple to dodge on its own, when paired with a number of abilities flying out from heroes, this is a powerful tool that is not to be ignored.” —Zekent_

* Vain crystal creates a line of explosions that deal 100 + 10% of the target’s max
* health and stuns for 1.2 seconds
* Deals 50% damage to Blackclaw \(captured\)
* Always available regardless of number of Armories remaining

### VAIN CRYSTAL SHIELDING

* 1 remaining: 25%
* 0 remaining: 0%

#### **ARMORIES**

**STATS**

* Health: 3000
* Defense: 190
* Minion Defense: 200

#### **ANTI-SNIPE BARRIER**

_“As an armory does not regenerate health, this barrier is to ensure that heroes with global ranged abilities are not able to take it down without being somewhat close to the action.” —Zekent_

* Disabled by lane minions \(17.5m\), Blackclaw \(17.5m\) and heroes \(17.5m\)
* If it has been more than 3 seconds since the barrier has been disabled, it will regenerate 100 barrier every 0.5 seconds up to 800 barrier

### TURRETS

#### **TURRET SCALING**

_“With the middle lane being more valuable in terms of map control, we made sure that the turrets in that lane were more durable than the ones in two side lanes. That being said, taking an early mid turret can be a very powerful start of your team’s offensive maneuvers.” —Zekent_

* Side-lane turrets are level 3/5/7
* Mid-lane turrets are level 4/6/8

#### **STATS**

* Health: 3000
* Damage: 160

**Minions:**

* Deals 25% of current health as true damage

**Heroes:**

* Deals 25% of current health as as structure damage

#### **EARLY-GAME RESILIENCE**

_“Turrets are a bit tougher to take down earlier on in matches, though a well coordinated push can still knock one down before the extra resilience wears off. This allows more opportunities for heroes to roam around the map without fearing for their turrets.” —Zekent_

* Has 50% reduction to incoming damage for the first 6 minutes of the game

#### **BACKDOOR BARRIER**

_“Similar to turrets on the Halcyon Fold, this barrier prevents a very particular, very unorthodox strategy from being employed.” —Zekent_

* Disabled by lane minions \(9m\) and blackclaw \(17m\)
* If it has been more than 3 seconds since the barrier has been disabled, it will regenerate 100 barrier every 0.5 seconds up to 800 barrier

### LANE MINIONS

_“These allies have increased importance on Sovereign’s Rise. With proper control of minion waves, you can create opportunities, apply pressure or create perfecdt cycles of waves that maximize your last-hitting potential.” —Zekent_

* A wave of minions spawns every 30 seconds with an initial spawn time of 0:45
* Minions all start at level 2 and start leveling up at 4:00 and gain 0.5 levels per minute \(rounded down\)

**MINION EMPOWERMENT**

_“Here’s a fun one! If minions are able to push up to the Vain crystal and force opposing minions to immediately turn their attention without passing by an Armory, they will have a fairly significant advantage in durability against their minion counterparts.” —Zekent_

* Allied minions which pass by an armory are granted 35 bonus minion defense

**MINION VICTORY BUFF**

_“Minions in the lane of a destroyed enemy armory will constantly be pushing toward the opposing side of the map. However, be careful as this does allow your opponents to have easier access to farming up those minions.” —Zekent_

* 30% increased damage to structures
* 30% increased damage to enemy minions
* 20% damage reduction against enemy heroes

### NEW 5V5-SPECIFIC ITEMS!

_“A new map calls for new items that not only allow for healthy gameplay, but also provide more interesting choices and tradeoffs. We’re moving toward a future where vision is a team effort, while still allowing players who want to focus on map and vision strategy to do so.” —Sonata_

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/vXfoIszVsmg\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Sovereign\'s Rise - Teleport Boots\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXfoIszVsmg/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXfoIszVsmg?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXfoIszVsmg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}
