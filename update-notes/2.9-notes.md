### **NEW HERO: CHURNWALKER**

_Churnwalker is a disruptor who throws multiple skillshot hooks, chaining victims to him. This playmaking captain has some of the highest damage and self-healing capabilities in the game … if you can tap into his full potential. _

_Churnwalker is unlockable with ICE only for the first seven days. Afterward, you will be able to unlock him with ICE or Glory._

### **HERO ABILITIES**

![](https://www.vainglorygame.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/churnwalker_talents_perk.jpg)

**FUTILITY OF LIFE \(HEROIC PERK\)**

– Whenever chained victims take damage from any source, Churnwalker regenerates a percentage of that damage as health.  
– Whenever any chained victim takes damage, a percentage of that damage is conferred on all other chained victims.

**HOOK & CHAIN \(A\)**

Churnwalker throws a skillshot hook that chains victims to him and damages heroes over time. Hitting a hook resets this ability’s cooldown.

**TORMENT \(B\)**

Torment yanks all chained victims toward Churnwalker a fixed distance, damaging them.

**TRESPASS \(ULTIMATE\)**

Churnwalker channels churn power for a short time, then travels to the target location, stunning all chained victims and breaking all chains. Churnwalker can only target a location near a chained victim. Leveling this ability increases its stun duration and lowers its cooldown.

### **HERO TALENTS**

**CHURN TANK \(RARE\)**

Futility of Life \(Perk\) has significantly increased healing but decreased damage share.

**CLOUD OF TORMENT \(EPIC\)**

Activating Torment \(B\) releases a powerful Churn Cloud that damages enemies over time, making Churnwalker a dangerous threat at close range. Cooldown increased.

**GRAPPLING HOOK \(LEGENDARY\)**

Churnwalker’s Hook & Chain \(A\) gains a grappling hook. This ability has dramatically increased range and can grapple to targets, pulling Churnwalker to the hooked location.

### **CRYSTAL TREE REWORK:  DISTINCT ITEM IDENTITIES & MORE DIVERSITY **

“Welcome to the crystal tree rework! There were two large goals we wanted to hit with this project: First, we wanted to create clear item identities — items should be distinct from each other and be clear what kind of playstyle they support, which makes it clear for opponents facing these items, as well. Second, we wanted to create more meaningful decisions when purchasing crystal items; it should never be about building the same items over and over again every game.

“With these changes, players should be able to piece together a completed crystal build that best complements their style, their hero and their team composition, as well as effectively counterbuilding against how their opponents are playing.” —Sonata

**CLOCKWORK**

“The old Clockwork had a mismatched item identity and lacked meaningful decision-making. The new Clockwork brands itself as the premier cooldown reduction item for mages and can be purchased early game for an aggressive power spike or late game to complement other crystal items. It’s a great purchase for players who want to deal consistent damage or poke.” —Sonata

* Total cost: **2500**
* Recipe: Void Battery and Chronograph
* **+60 **crystal power
* **+35% **cooldown speed
* **+250 **max energy
* **+7.5** energy regen
* Passive: Upon damaging an enemy hero with an ability, reduce all cooldowns by **7.5%**. This can only occur once every **2** seconds.

**FROSTBURN**

![](https://www.vainglorygame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/frostburn1.png)

“The old Frostburn provided unreliable slows, so it wasn’t clear when you should opt into it or when it was available. The new Frostburn provides a hero with reliable slows at the cost of damage potential, and it is great for players who want to opt into a kite or dueling-oriented playstyle, or players who want to support their team through providing an additional source of slow.” —Sonata

* Total cost: **2800**
* Recipe: Heavy Prism and Eclipse Prism
* **+85** crystal power
* Passive: Crystal damage abilities slow enemy heroes by **30%** for 1 second.

**BROKEN MYTH**

![](https://www.vainglorygame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/broken-myth.png)

“With the addition of Dragon’s Eye, Broken Myth lost its passive but hones in on its shield-piercing properties. Broken Myth is now defined as the go-to item for players who want to punch a hole in enemies with heavy amounts of shield.” —Sonata

* Total cost: **2700**
* Recipe: Heavy Prism and Piercing Shard
* **+80** crystal power
* Shieldbreaker: **+30%** shield pierce

### **NEW ITEMS!**

**DRAGON’S EYE**

_“The old Broken Myth passive amplified crystal damage and had a longer time until stack decay, which made it only desired by crystal carries and made fighting against poke more oppressive. As the descendent of the old Broken Myth passive, Dragon’s Eye is a great buy for players who want to go in and stay in, including supports! The dance of keeping stacks up also emphasizes skillful play from those who want to kite.” —Sonata_

* Total cost: 3000
* Recipe: Heavy Prism and Eclipse Prism
* +85 crystal power
* Passive: Gain 20 crystal power for each second you are damaging enemy heroes. After 2.5s, lose 3 stacks per second. 9 stacks max.

**SPELLFIRE**

_“Spellfire is an item meant to complement players who want to opt into a more poke- and disengage-oriented playstyle. At the cost of max damage potential, this item allows players to deal more damage in multiple segmented skirmishes instead of burst or prolonged engagements.” —Sonata_

* Total cost: 2700
* Recipe: Heavy Prism and Eclipse Prism
* +90 crystal power
* Passive: Abilities dealing crystal damage to enemies \(excluding lane minions\) deal 100% of your crystal power as bonus crystal damage over 4s.

**TEAMFIGHT HEALTH UPDATE: PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT**

“In conjunction with the crystal tree rework, the teamfight health update is meant to clearly differentiate burst damage, sustained damage, poke, etc., across all heroes. These changes should give you more opportunities to stretch your hero’s limits, while making defensive choices more meaningful.” —Sonata

See heroes and items affected by these changes in the balance sections below.

**VISION CHANGES: GAME-CHANGING CLARITY**

“We’re making changes to our in-game visibility systems to improve the look and feel of combat in Vainglory. Hero vision range has been significantly increased to enhance visual clarity and reduce the need for Flares in stand-off skirmishes where stealthed heroes are not present. Landing a blind skillshot on an enemy in brush or otherwise out of your line-of-sight will now grant you vision of the target, and vice versa, preventing any instances of invisible damage from occurring. We hope these new interactions will allow players to create more moments of opportunistic gameplay when using their abilities in creative manners.” —s4v0r

**VISION RADIUS**

* Hero vision radius increased by 50%

  **UNIT REVEALER**

**BASIC ATTACKS**

* **Will **reveal the attacker to the defender for **2.2 **seconds.
* **Will not **reveal the defender.

**ABILITY DAMAGE**

* **Will **reveal the attacker and defender for **1.5 **seconds.
* **Will **reveal jungle minions, including Kraken
* **Will not **reveal lane minions or summons
* Lingering damage-over-time effects **will not **reveal

_**Example:** Skaarf’s initial Spitfire impact damage will reveal, but the burn will not._

**STEALTH**

* The new revealer **does** **not **impede stealth.

_**Example: **Before Update 2.9, some attack or ability debuffs would apply an over-the-head “revealed” state to enemies, making them fully visible. This is no longer the case with any of the new unit reveals._

### **DAMAGE TYPE CONSISTENCY & LANE-MINION DAMAGE NORMALIZATION**

**DAMAGE TYPE CONSISTENCY **

“There were a few instances of abilities being considered other types of damage. This has now been remedied and effects that trigger on ability damage will now function properly in the following cases.” —Zekent

* See heroes affected by these changes in the balance change section below.
* **LANE-MINION DAMAGE NORMALIZATION**

  “There are many abilities that deal less damage to lane minions, preventing the hero from clearing minion waves too quickly. The damage reduction was not consistent; however, and some abilities had unique calculations to determine how much damage the lane minions would receive. We’re simplifying this by making the aforementioned abilities deal 50% less damage to lane minions and, in some cases, to structures and bosses as well. The only exception is Baron’s Rocket Launcher \(perk\), which will still deal 80% less damage to minions.” —Doomnyr

See heroes affected by these changes in the balance change section below.

**  
ADDITIONAL META CHANGES    
**

** EXPERIENCE SHARE**

* Two heroes: Increased from **75/65%** to **85**/**75%**
* Three heroes: Increased from **51/47/47%** to **60/50/50%**

** LIFESTEAL**

* **Weapon lifesteal** and c**rystal lifesteal** have been unified to simply** lifesteal,** which affects both types of damage unless otherwise specified.

**PIERCING**

Piercing will no longer be as effective as it was in previous updates. Armor and shield on items and heroes has been adjusted to compensate for this change. —Zekent

* Piercing now ignores a percentage of defenses on a target instead of having a percentage of damage bypass it completely.

**KRAKEN**

* Kraken base health decreased **20%**
* Captured Kraken base health increased **25%**
* Capturing the Kraken no longer stops minions from spawning

**MELEE LANE MINION**

BLITZ CHANGES

**JUNGLE SENTRY**

_Now, sentries are very dangerous, especially if you try to solo them as a glass-cannon. But if you’re a jungler or a team, they are much safer to take._

* Sentries now have higher defense & damage when you first start attacking, but their stats decay at the rate of 1 stack per second over 15 seconds while in combat. Stacks are recovered at the rate of 1 stack per 3 seconds.

  * 15 stacks max_ _
