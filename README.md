  * [ ] etc
* [ ] in the main items page, leave only the full price for tier 2 & 3 items, having the other prices is confusing \(you will learn what builds into what in the detailed pages so having it here is redundant\).
* [ ] in “other” might want to add the scout cam even tho is not purchasable - since the section is referring to items and not “shop items” only.
* [ ] add information about the hero’s role in the main page and hero’s page \(maybe even considering adding the ability to filter by role\)
* [ ] might want to mention the skins in a list \(and the rarity\) for each hero in the main page, since the lores are in each hero’s page
* [ ] Heroes =&gt; would it look better if instead having the image centered? It would be on the left with the text on the right, then the numbers underneath as it is
* [ ] Lore =&gt; have consistency with the structure - i.e. title + image + text
* [ ] Common Terms =&gt; “bot/mid/top” lanes missing \(as I see jungle and lane in there for example\)

  - “Carry” as the 3v3 role

* [ ] make sure to hyperlink Heroes to their more in-depth pages from the larger list of heroes
* [ ]  A list of our past in-game events \(like the Malene one right now\)
* [ ] Update notes once we stopped making the article for them.
