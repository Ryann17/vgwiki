# 1.0.9 Notes

## Join Forces. Control Your Fate.

**Jun 06, 2014**

_This is a big one. Update 1.09 introduces a milestone feature that gives you the power to choose your teammates and enter the Public Match queue as a pre-made party._

_That’s right: Your friends. Your call. Your destiny in your own hands._

_For anyone frustrated by AFK or skill-mismatched teammates, this is the answer and feature you’ve needed. For all those wondering how to easily play with real-life friends and siblings, this is the feature you’re after. For all those who have made elite allies _[_in the forums_](http://forums.vainglorygame.com/)_, this is your chance to band together for epic matches unlike anything you’ve been thrown into. You now have control over your own team and your own fate._

_Let’s break it down …_

## **Get the Party Started!**

I hope you’ve been adding friends pre- and post-match … because your Friends list actually has purpose now!

**1. Tap into the PLAY section.**

**2. Smack CREATE PARTY.**

**3. Invite one or two online friends by tapping on their player name. \(Look for the green dot\). **Friends who accept your invite will join you in your pre-made team. If someone declines, bails or is out to lunch, just “x” ’em out of your party and invite someone else.
