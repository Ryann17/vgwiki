#### **NEW HERO: LORELAI**



Lorelai is a backline support who excels at zone control and team utility. Change the tides of battle with single-target cleanses and shields.

Lorelai is unlockable with ICE only for the first seven days. Afterward, you will be able to unlock her with ICE or Glory.

#### **HERO ABILITIES**



![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Perk_thats_swell-150x150.jpg) **THAT’S SWELL \(HEROIC PERK\)**

Lorelai’s basic attacks deal crystal damage and she becomes empowered when she’s on a source of water from her abilities. Using an ability while Lorelai’s on a source of water consumes the water she’s on and empowers the ability used.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/A_icon_Fish_Food-1-150x150.jpg)**FISH FOOD \(A\)**

Lorelai calls upon her aquatic friends at the target location. After 0.8 seconds, her pet clam snaps the area, dealing damage to enemy units inside and stunning them.

* A pool filled with small piranhas persists for 8 seconds afterwards, dealing damage over time to enemy units inside

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/B_Icon_Splashdown-150x150.jpg)**SPLASHDOWN \(B\)**

Lorelai throws a sphere of water at target location. After a short delay, the water forms a pool for 8 seconds, speeding up allies and slowing enemies inside.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/C_Icon_Waterfall-1-150x150.jpg)**WATERWALL \(ULTIMATE\)**

Lorelai forms a protective veil of water on target allied hero cleansing the target of any movement-impairing effects.

* After a short delay, the water barrier drops on the ground, leaving behind a pool for 8 seconds.
* Temporarily grants the target a large barrier.



#### **HERO TALENTS**

When we started Super Evil Megacorp, we set out to challenge the notion that mobile-first gamers were somehow inferior to gamers on other platforms.

Our mission now is creating a 5v5 MOBA with the **most accurate and responsive controls**, with **superior gameplay and strategic depth** and with the **best graphics and highest frame rates** on mobile. Vainglory 5v5 will make no compromises, and we want you to have a chance to play before anyone else.

![bottom\_bracket](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bracket2.png)

**ALPHA**

_“Alpha has been a reliable pick in recent updates and while we are happy she is finally seeing competitive play again, we feel she can use a slight update. This will give the enemy team more time to fight Alpha while her reboot is down. This change to the ult coupled with the aftershock nerf should bring her more into line with the others while still maintaining her identity.” —Nivmett_

**TERMINATION PROTOCOL**

* Cooldown increased from 75/65/55 to 85/75/65

**ARDAN**

_“Ardan has been a very strong and reliable pick this update, largely because his perk has taken advantage of the health changes more than most.”  —Nivmett_

**JULIA’S GIFT**

* Missing-life healed reduced from 1.5% to 0.8%

**BARON**

_“Baron’s move speed has been unnaturally slow. This tuneup will bring him in line with Phinn \(not exactly a speed demon\). Changes to Jump Jets and Porcupine Mortars may open the doors for more CP Baron in the future.” —Nivmett_

 —Nivmett_

**HELIOGENESIS**

* Energy cost reduced from **50** to **40**

**FLICKER**

_“While Flicker is closer to where we want him than ever before, the mad scientist may need a few more bumps to get him there.”

**SHIMMER STRIKE**

* Now cleanses move-impairing effects on activation

_

_

**REZA**

_  
_  
 **NETHERFORM DETONATOR**

* Weapon power reduced from **50-127** to **50-116**

**SAMUEL**

_“Samuel was running out of energy before the fights could conclude more often than not. This will help fix that.”  
 —Nivmett  
_  
 **MALICE AND VERDICT**

* Energy cost decreased from **50/55/60/65/70** to **40/45/50/55/60**

**PETAL**

_“Petal has been strong for quite some time — and while it’s great to see her picked frequently in competitive play, her damage combined with range and mobility were too much. This tunedown will bring her in line with the other weapon carries.” —Nivmett_

**TRAMPOLINE**

* Weapon amp reduced from **20%** to **15%**
* Crystal amp reduced from **20%** to **15%**

**REIM**

_“These changes will help push Reim toward his intended playstyle as a sustain crystal bruiser rather than some sort of crystal sustain, burst bruiser. In short, he will deal significantly less damage but generate more fortified health. In addition, the range change to Winter Spire will allow him to fight ranged heroes a bit easier in the early game.” —Nivmett_

**FROST GUARD**

* Crystal ratio on basic-attack reduced from **90%** to **70%**
* Damage to fortified health increased from **18%** to **25%**

 _“Despite the Frostburn changes making the item very powerful, the decreased crystal and increased price made it a disadvantageous purchase. By bringing it to a lower price point, it is now attractive not only as a solid pickup but also serves crystal heroes as a kite-for-survival tool if they pick it up early enough.” —Nivmett_
