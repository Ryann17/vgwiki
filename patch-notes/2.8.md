#### **NEW SEASON, NEW RANK**



**SHOW OFF & RANK UP**

Each Vainglory season is a fresh challenge with new dynamics. Resetting players’ rank gives all players a chance to advance every season and show their true skill in an ever-evolving meta. And this season, we’re granting all players bonus progress on their Autumn rank based on prior Ranked performance for a head start.

By displaying last season’s rank to allies only on the match loading screen, players can take pride in showing off their latest milestone accomplishment, without worrying about the midseason stress of displaying a rank that’s moving up and down. A seasonal-best rank is a symbol you’ve _earned_ of your hard work and exceptional play — and it can serve as something aspirational to surpass in your current season. Aim to beat that rank number, and make Autumn your biggest accomplishment yet!

* Your Summer rank is now immortalized in your profile’s Trophy Case.
* See your best Summer rank along with your allies’ on the Ranked match loading screen.
* Your rank will be reset for the start of Autumn, along with bonus progress based on past performance. Rank up for a fresh challenge.



#### **NEW ITEMS!**



![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/spellsword_item.png)

**SPELLSWORD**

_“Spellsword fills two holes we have had in our game for a long time: First, weapon carries never really had a decent item they could purchase if they consumed energy at a faster rate. Nor did they have any item they could purchase really to provide cooldown. And in replacing Halcyon Potions with Healing Flask, we’re hitting energy options for some weapon builds particularly hard. Spellsword will address these needs while still maintaining the identity of a weapon carry._

_“Secondly, when the game was originally released, there was a very distinct split between abilities that did crystal damage and basic attacks that did weapon damage. We have since broken that mold by introducing more ability-oriented heroes — weapon casters, if you may. This item is a perfect fit for many of those heroes while also creating some interesting choices for other weapon heroes who are willing to trade the damage for utility.” —Nivmett_

* Passive: Basic attacks grant you 3 energy \(9 on heroes\)
* Builds out of Six Sins and Chronograph
* 90 Weapon Power
* 35% Cooldown Speed
* 2.5 Energy Recharge
* Purchase for 2600 gold; sells for 1300

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Healing_Flask_item.jpg)

**HEALING FLASK**

_“We’re removing Halcyon Potions and replacing them with a new item, Healing Flask, which blocks incoming damage and recovers a significant portion of your health and energy. Our goal with this item is to provide players more impactful and obvious decision points with healing. Healing Flask will have an impact on lane dynamics, itemization strategy and skirmishing.” —Ciderhelm_

* Activate: Block 115-500 damage \(based on hero level\) and recover 30% health and energy over the next 5 seconds. \(120 second cooldown\)
* Sells for 0 gold, can be repurchased for 300 gold
* Automatically in inventory upon start of Standard matches

#### **BATTLE READINESS:  MORE DANGER. EXPLOSIVE ACTION.**



Great gameplay comes from making meaningful decisions and managing risk. And in a MOBA, most risk/reward scenarios revolve around heroes’ health. _Can you secure that kill under enemy turret and live to tell the tale? Can you time your Fountain perfectly to turn the tide of the fight?  Can you 1v2 and become a legend?_

But one of the most delicious areas of risk is around jungle “battle readiness.” It’s the constant dance between clearing camps and earning max gold vs being ready for the next fight happening any moment. Battle readiness has been a major factor in designing Vainglory’s new 5v5 map — especially the layout and function of the 5v5 jungle — but those deliberations helped us realize that battle readiness was a big opportunity for Halcyon Fold 3v3 as well. Simply put, most fights to date happen at full health, and that removes a major teamfight dimension.

So, for Autumn season, we’re blowing up the stale meta and introducing an entirely new way to think about jungle engagements:

Potions … gone.

Book & Barbed Needle healing … slashed.

Healing cooldowns … intensified.

The result is a jungle fraught with more danger, more explosive action — and much more interesting decision points. The tradeoff between gold efficiency and battle readiness will definitely take some getting used to. You can no longer clear every camp and expect to live through an ambush. “Fight or farm?” will become _the_ question on players’ minds. And once you realize the windows of opportunity this meta change creates, there’s a world of strategies you’ll want to try. When combined with two new items in the mix, Autumn season is going to be a wild ride …

**HALCYON POTIONS REMOVED**

* Potions are no longer available in the Shop
* All heroes have additional 1 health regen & 1 energy regen per second

#### **JUNGLE STRATEGY**



**DUO JUNGLING RETURNS**

_“These changes will give captains compelling reasons to roam the jungle instead of babysitting lane all game long.” —Nivmett_

* Lane minion ambient gold reduced from **75% to 60%**
* Jungle ambient gold increased from **75% to 85%**
* Duo-shared experience has been changed from **65/60% to 75/70%**
* Triple-shared experience changed from **45%/40%/40% to 51%/47%/47%**
* Fixed a bug where experience granted was slightly lower than intended.

**GOLD MINER**

* * Health up from **1200 + 200 per level to 2500 + 0 per level**
  * Damage down from **80 + 12 per level to 40 + 10 per level**
  * Attack speed changed from **100% + 5% per level to 150% + 0% per level**
  * Armor and shield changed from **70 + 10 per level to 0 + 30 per level**
  * Max gold up from **300 to 400**
  * Max fill time down from **4 minutes to 3**
  * Miner’s basic attacks now apply a **decaying slow** starting at 35% and falling off over 1.4 seconds
  * Miner’s attack projectile speed up from **7 to 12**

**CRYSTAL SENTRY**

* Damage down from **135 + 30 per level to 80 + 20 per level**
* Attack speed up from **165% + 5% per level to 200%**
* Basic attacks now apply a **decaying slow** starting at 35% and falling off over 1.4 seconds
* Attack projectile speed up from **7 to 12**
* Sentry’s area of protection has reduced by **6 meters.**

**JUNGLE CAMPS**

* Front camps base basic-attack damage down from **40 to 32**
* Back minion duo base basic-attack damage down from **68 to 60**



#### **BLITZ BALANCE**



_Blitz continues to evolve as we observe how people play and consider player feedback. _

* The Middle Sentry is slightly easier to take down
* Allied \(side\) sentries will no longer protect allies in an area; they will just defend themselves.
* Allied sentries no longer recall and now respawn in place just like Middle Sentry
* Allied sentries are harder to kill, but they have lower regeneration



#### **PLAYER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS**



_A new season gives us a chance to level up parts of the player experience that deserve more attention, like the steps players must take to navigate through their skin and talent collections._

**NEW HERO BROWSER**

* Browse all skins in one convenient location
* Jump to a hero by letter
* Easily craft and buy hero skins

**TALENT BROWSER**

* Browse all talents in one place
* Jump to a hero by letter to view their talents
* Easily inspect and upgrade talents

**TALENT UPGRADES**

* The green talent upgrade indicators now clear after you’ve seen them
* Green upgrade frame remains for any talents you can afford to upgrade

**MATCH LOADING SCREEN**

* Your Ranked skill tier for the **previous completed season** \(in this case Summer\) will appear on the Ranked match loading screen.
* Your **final Summer Blitz Score** \(to the nearest 100\) will appear on the Blitz match loading screen.
* These tier numbers are visible to **you and your allies**.

**RANKED PARTY RESTRICTION**

_“One common source of player frustration is wondering why they were matched with players way above or below their skill tier. Often, this happened because a party had a dramatic skill tier disparity between players, causing the other team to be match-made similarly. While it’s understandable that a highly skilled player might mentor someone newer to the game, the wide range of possible outcomes was giving players whiplash. So, we’ve instituted a ‘1-tier’ rule to better ensure players in ranked matches will be similarly skilled.” —PlayoffBeard_

* **You can no longer enter Ranked queue as a party if your total skill tier is greater than 1 tier apart. **_For example, Simply Amazing \(Tier 8\) Silver can, at most, party with Pinnacle of Awesome \(Tier 9\) Silver or The Hotness \(Tier 7\) Silver._

**‘TODAY’S TALENTS’ MARKET**

* The daily ‘Pick 3’ now rotates every 12 hours! Be sure to stop back with the selection of talents changes.

**WIN COUNTERS**

_“Want to see how you’ve performed in Blitz, Battle Royale, Ranked and more? Now you can track every win and notch those Ws. Some players will see larger-than-expected win counts because we were counting bot matches for a time. We’re not anymore.” —PlayoffBeard_

* See your **overall win count** for each game mode

**REDUCING TOXICITY: LOW PRIORITY QUEUE**

_“The Low Priority Queue is supposed to be a deterrent sufficient to alter bad player behavior. But offending players would often just “kill time” or ignore LPQ by using secondary player accounts. By disabling logout during LPQ, it forces players to sit in the penalty box and play their way back into the game’s good graces. We’ll monitor this closely to see if it’s effective in reducing player toxicity.” —PlayoffBeard_

* Players in Low Priority Queue for bad behavior cannot log out of their account to play on a smurf until the LPQ timer expires

**TUTORIAL IMPROVEMENTS**

* Removed blocking modals
* Changed the second tutorial to 1v1 instead of 3v3
* Added English voiceover instructions
* Note: Voiceover instructions for other languages will come in future updates

#### **ANDROID KEYBOARD & MOUSE SUPPORT**



![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mousekeyboard.jpg)

Autumn season introduces Vainglory keyboard & mouse support on select Android platforms, including the [Samsung DeX Station. ](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/dex-station---black-ee-mg950tbegus/)That’s right, you’ll be able to play with the classic QWER ability key bindings and numeric item activations.

When we [unveiled this news at gamescom](http://www.superevilmegacorp.com/blog/vainglory-to-introduce-mouse-and-keyboard-support-with-samsung-dex) in August, some players expressed fears that it signaled a move away from mobile or touchscreen controls — or that it could provide keyboard players with an unfair advantage.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

First, Vainglory is a mobile game built for the touchscreen generation of players. Mobile gaming is rapidly growing, and it’s absolutely the place we want to be. We have no plans for general release on PC or Mac. Second, devs such as Ciderhelm and Zekent have been playing Vainglory for _years_ with a mouse and keyboard during internal playtesting. Zekent was a MOBA pro and many of us in the Lair come from PC gaming backgrounds. Our conclusion from playing with keyboard & mouse is that there is no advantage over touchscreen controls — and that some things such as stutter stepping are more natural through the tap interface. There are no specific keyboard & mouse optimizations beyond the QWER keys and number keys for items. But partnering with hardware makers lets us demonstrate the power of our E.V.I.L. game engine and get the word out about Vainglory, which is really helpful in growing the game.

We will, of course, be monitoring usage very closely, and if we see anything unintended, we’ll immediately address it. So, don’t fret … and if you’re curious, check out the new keyboard & mouse support! _—PlayoffBeard_

* Optimized for keyboard & mouse play on Android operating systems
* Uses QWER ability keys & numeric item activations

**CORE CHARGE**

* Weapon ratio increased from **100%** to **110%**

**GAUNTLET**

* Cooldown reduced from **110-100-90** to **100-90-80**

**BAPTISTE**

“Baptiste polished his Scythe. He has been a popular pick as of late. His burst was a bit too strong. While at the same time his weapon path had been near forgotten. This change will equalize them, allowing both paths to be choosable.” — Nivmett

**BAD MOJO**

* Crystal ratio reduced from **110%** to **105%**

**REAP**

**BLAST TREMOR**

* Cooldown increased from **80-70-60 to 100-85-70**

**GRACE**

“With her perk, Grace’s ultimate was a bit too much all game. This change should not only match her cooldown but also tune down the Echo build she tends to utilize.” — Nivmett

**STATS**

**DIVINE INTERVENTION**

  * Buff duration increased from **4.5-4.5-4.5-4.5-5.5** to **5-5-5-5-6**

  **GLIMMERSHOT**

  * Crystal ratio reduced from **160%** to **140%**

  **KRUL**

  “Krul is finally in a good spot, but with the reduction of sustain he was a bit too good.” — Nivmett

  **DEAD MAN’S RUSH**

  * Barrier reduced from **100-180-260-340-420** to **80-160-240-320-400**

  **LYRA**

  “With the changes to sustain, healers became too much of a powerhouse.” — Nivmett

  **IMPERIAL SIGIL**

  * Cooldown increased from **10-9.5-9-8.5-8** to **14-12.5-11-9.5-8**

  **PHINN**

  “Phinn has been slightly outclassed by other supports for a while now. With more early-game aggression expected in Autumn season, Phinn will need to be more ready.”— Nivmett

  **POLITE COMPANY**

  * Fortified health increased from **120-150-180-210-240** to **140-170-200-230-290**

* **TROUBLEMAKER**

  * Recovery Dash Delay from **0.2** to **0.1**

  **SKAARF**

  “Skaarf is seeing more jungle play, but his clear speed is a little too high and a bit too free. This will bring him in line with other heroes while giving him a bit easier time in early skirmishes and laning.” — Nivmett

  **FAN THE FLAMES**

  * Perk damage down from **10** to **8**

* **SPITFIRE**
  * * Cooldown decreased from **6-5.5-5-4.5-3** to **5-4.5-4-3.5-3.0**
    * Crystal ratio down from **150%** to **130%**
* **GOOP**

  * Damage per second reduced from **60-100-140-180-220** to **40-85-130-175-220**

  **SKYE**

  “This should make Skye players feel more rewarded for landing a locked-on Forward Barrage.“ — Nivmett

  **FORWARD BARRAGE**

  * Lock-on damage bonus crystal ratio increased from **33%** to **35%**

  **TAKA**

  “Taka has been having a little trouble ever since we nerfed the cooldown on his perk. With potions gone, Taka takes a bit more damage than before. So, we are giving him back his old perk power.” — Nivmett

  **HOUSE KAMUHA**

  * Cooldown per stack increased from **20%** to **25%**



  **ADDITIONAL ITEM CHANGES**



  **SCOUT TRAP  
  **“Most players will likely be surprised at how large the radius of sight actually is. With this change, there will be no doubt on how much traps can or cannot see.” —Nivmett

  * Added an outline showing the true vision radius of the scout trap

  **CONTRACTS: DRAGONBLOOD, PROTECTOR & IRONGUARD**

  * Price reduced from **300** to **250**

  **ECHO**

  _“We were happy to see Echo being purchased much more frequently, but how often it was coming up was slightly off.” —Nivmett_

  * Cooldown increased from **115% + 10 seconds** to **115% + 15 seconds**

  **LEVEL JUICE**

  _“Want to practice combos or check out a new hero’s ultimate? Jump to Practice level 12 with this tasty, fruity Level Juice beverage.” —  PlayoffBeard_

  **BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**



  **‘FREEZE’ BUG**

  Some players experienced very unfortunate and frustrating “freeze” issues in matches during Update 2.7. Many of these issues were addressed with a hotfix during the 2.7 cycle, and the rest of the issues should be resolved in this Autumn season \(2.8\) update.

  For context, the root cause of these issues was that we’re optimizing our game engine to make play smoother on 3v3 and to make sure we’re ready for a smooth 5v5 play experience on low-end mobile devices. Unfortunately, these kinds of tech changes sometimes introduce bugs.

  We’ve done everything we can to ensure that in Autumn season, players can _focus on_ _fun, _not freezes or other pain.  Thanks for your patience.

  * **Resolved: “freeze” bug**
  * **BUG FIXES**
  * Grumpjaw will no longer instantaneously attack twice after activating Hangry.
  * Fixed a bug where stealthed enemy heroes could be detected by the change in allied nameplates
  * Fixed a bug where Petal would occasionally permanently lose her munions
  * Recalling now stops Skye’s forward barrage and also breaks the lock from Suri Strike
  * Rapidly moving back and forth while locked on as Skye no longer occasionally causes her position to get out of sync between the client and server.
  * Catherine’s Stormguard damage ticks now have their damage calculated each tick, rather than all up front. This means upgrading the ability or buying an item in the middle of it being active will make the remaining ticks do more damage.
  * Fixed a bug where the Sanctuary platform speed boost would not instantly refresh
  * Addressed a reported “black screen” issue. _Note: If you experience this in Update 2.8, please tell us immediately. If the issue persists for any players, we will immediately investigate and remedy._
