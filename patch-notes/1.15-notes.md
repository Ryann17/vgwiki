#### **FINAL UPDATE OF WINTER SEASON**

_As Winter Season winds down, we took special care to smooth any rough edges without too many major changes. We want this update to alleviate any pain but still feel familiar. _

**HERO RESPAWN TIMER – TURRET REDUCTIONS**

Introducing this mechanic helped teams that defended their turrets properly not lose in one big push. We are adjusting the percentage reduction to prevent games from running longer than intended. —SurpriseBirthday

* **Respawn timer clock refund per turret kill down from 15%** to **10%**.

**JUNGLE MONSTERS**

We’re adjusting how jungle monsters scale at different stages of the game so they don’t overwhelm players at lower tiers who don’t farm as efficiently. Now, the monsters should offer a consistent challenge for most farming speeds. —SurpriseBirthday

* Jungle monsters strength now scales with team net gold rather than time in game.

**DAMAGE CLARIFICATION**

* Spectator mode now displays which team scores the last hit on jungle monsters.

![header\_hero\_balance\_changes\_new](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/header_hero_balance_changes_new.png)

**KRUL  
**

_We wanted to create a viable crystal build path for Krul without disrupting weapon Krul too much. Plus, now Weakness stacks will impact crystal-building heroes in addition to attack-speed carries. —SurpriseBirthday_

**SHADOWS EMPOWER ME**

* Bug fix: Perk is now activated as long as Krul is idle in a bush for **1.5** seconds.
* Bug fix: Fix cases where perk did not activate when it should have. 

**DEAD MAN’S RUSH**

* Damage from **150-200-250-300-530 + 70% crystal ratio + 100% weapon ratio** to **160% basic attack + 70% CR.**
* Barrier duration now has a **0.2% crystal ratio**
* Barrier up from **80-160-240-320-600 + 75% CR** to **100-200-300-400-600 + 125% CR.**

**SPECTRAL SMITE**

* Damage per stack changed from **16-34-52-70-110 + 10% CR **to **20-35-50-65-95 + 20% CR.**
* Base heal changed from **36-48-60-72-164** to **40-60-80-100-140.**
* Heal per stack changed from **12-17-22-27-47 + 10% CR** to **15-20-25-30-40 + 20% CR.**

**WEAKNESS**

* No longer reduces target’s crystal power or attack speed by 10% per stack. Instead, weakness generally reduces a hero’s damage output by **6.25% **per stack \(50% at 8 stacks\).

**FROM HELL’S HEART**

* Stun duration changed from **2-2-2 **to **1.8-2.0-2.2** seconds.

**FORTRESS**

_Not taking damage from abilities made Fortress’ wolves much stronger against certain hero types. We want each hero to have a way to deal with these ferocious doggies. —AdyEndrus_

**ATTACK OF THE PACK**

* Wolves have **300-450-600 health, 150 armor, 150 shield plus 20%** of Fortress’ **bonus**defensive stats.
* Wolves are affected normally by all damage types.
* Basic attacks always deal strictly 1/3 of a wolf’s health.
* Fortress’ health gained from **250-550-850** to **250-450-650.**

**PETAL**

We want players to have more options for which skill to put points into, so we’re adding incentives to her Trampoline. Her munions’ survivability was tuned too low and they were too easy to kill, so that has also been addressed. —SurpriseBirthday

**MUNIONS**

* Health up from **60-110-160-210-310 + 15% CR** to **110-200-290-380-560 + 30% CR.**
* Armor & shield down from **120-125-130-135-145 + 12% CR** to **20-25-30-35-45 + 5% CR.**
* Damage up from **7-15-23-31-47** to **8-16-24-32-48.**

**TRAMPOLINE**

* Activation amplifies weapon power by **8-12-16-20-24%** and crystal power by **15-20-25-30-35%** for **4** seconds.
* Cooldown up from **8-7-6-5-3** to **10-9-8-7-5.**

**VOX**

_Touched up a few things that were granting him unnecessary power. —Zekent_

**SONIC ZOOM**

* Activating this ability no longer resets Vox’s basic-attack cooldown.

**WAIT FOR IT …**

* The hitbox of this ability was slightly modified to match how it looks in game.

**RINGO**

_A good compromise to Ringo’s lane presence is adjusting the energy cost of Twirling Silver to encourage Ringo to decide the best times to use this ability, rather than always having a six-second steroid available. —SurpriseBirthday_

**ACHILLES SHOT**

* Energy cost down from **32-50-68-86-104** to **30-45-60-75-90.**
* Damage adjusted from **80-125-170-215-380 + 110% CR** to **80-125-170-215-350 + 125% CR**

**TWIRLING SILVER**

* Energy cost up from **30-38-46-54-70** to **50-60-70-80-90.**
* Bonus attack speed down at earlier ranks from **55-64-73-82-100%** to **50-60-70-80-100%.**

**KOSHKA**

_Koshka was bringing all her Twirly Death stacks to a fight, allowing her to preload damage. We’re implementing a change that will encourage Koshka players to position themselves in a fight to maximize their damage potential. —Zekent_

**POUNCY FUN**

* Cooldown up from **12-11.5-11-10.5-10** to **14-13-12-11-10.**

**TWIRLY DEATH**

* Cooldown up from **15-14-13-12-11** to **16-15-14-13-12.**
* Twirly Death stack duration down from **infinite** to **10** seconds.
* Energy cost up from **36-44-52-60-78** to **40-50-60-70-80.**

**REIM**

_We’re incentivizing clipping enemies with either hit of Winter Spire as well as toning Reim’s level six trick down a bit. Landing Winter Spire will feel much more rewarding now. —AdyEndrus_

**WINTER SPIRE**

* Initial damage up from **60-70-80-90-110** to **80-110-140-170-200.**
* Delayed damage up from **120-140-160-180-220** to **120-160-200-240-280.**

**VALKRYIE**

* Center crystal ratio down from **240%** to **160%.**
* Edge crystal ratio down from **160%** to **100%.**

**RONA**

_In internal playtests, Rona was out-of-control strong after fixing how Fortified Health worked with Red Mist. We tuned some numbers to help her feel mortal again internally, but for all the players out there on 1.15, she will feel considerably more dangerous. —SurpriseBirthday_

**BERSERKER’S FURY**

* Damage per basic attack up from **70%** to **75%.**

**INTO THE FRAY**

* No longer generates Bloodrage when you land on enemy heroes.

**FOESPLITTER**

* Weapon ratio increased to match her perk from **70%** to **75%.**
* Fixed a bug that was lowering the damage of the second activation the more Fury that was consumed.
* No longer gains bonus damage the more Fury that’s consumed

**RED MIST**

* Correctly generates fortified health **every second** during Red Mist.
* Reduced Fortified Health generated from this ability down from **50-75-100** to **35-50-65. **

**PHINN**

_Phinn is getting smoother scaling to make his company less polite at earlier levels. This change should make him feel more impactful as he stomps around the Fold, without creating more footprints.  —Zekent_

**BASE STATS**

* **Level 1 health **up from **881** to **960**.

**POLITE COMPANY**

* Damage up from **60-90-120-150-350** to **60-120-180-240-360.**
* Fortified health duration up from **3-3-3-3-3** to **3-3-3-3-4.**
* Pull distance up from **25-25-25-25-35%** to **30-30-30-30-30%.**

**KESTREL**

_Traps now feel more rewarding when cleverly placed and triggered. It’s an integral part of Kestrel’s toolkit that we want players taking advantage of! —Zekent_

**GLIMMERSHOT**

* Corrected the arrow hitbox to match the visual effect.
* Reload time returned from **4.0** to **3.3** seconds.

**ACTIVE CAMO**

* Trap damage up from **80-130-180-230-280 + 180% CR** to **120-180-240-300-420 + 220% CR.**

**TAKA**

_We are adding some interesting utility to Kaku to compensate for the slightly extended ultimate animation. It’s a bit of give and take, but it’s enough of a nudge to create fun scenarios. —Zekent_

**KAKU**

* Heal per second up from **40-45-50-55-85** to **40-50-60-70-100.**

**X-RETSU**

* Taka’s X-Retsu no longer skips the wind-up animation.

**SKAARF**

_Dragon Breath has been overshadowed by Goop and Spitfire. This change creates new reasons to put points in Skaarf’s ultimate. —Zekent_

* Dragon Breath damage up from **550-875-1200** to **650-925-1200**.

**CELESTE**

_Expect to see more Celeste in 1.15, as this change brings more utility to Celeste without adding extra damage. —Zekent_

* Core Collapse cooldown down from **24-22-20-18-10** to **16-15-14-13-10**.

**OZO**

_We are rounding Ozo’s numbers to give him a bit of a buff. We like our latest hero and want his numbers to make sense. No more of this uneven scaling monkey business. —Zekent_

**THREE-RING CIRCUS**

* Clarification: All damage from this ability can critically strike. However, only the primary target suffers basic-attack effects.
* Heal per enemy hit up from **15-24-33-42-51 \(4-6-8-10-12 against non-heroes\)** to **15-25-35-45-55 \(30% of that against non-heroes\).**

**ADAGIO**

_Adagio has been showing his power as a crystal mage, but we want to make sure there’s still a viable tank-Adagio alternative. With a small increase in base values at the expense of crystal ratio, we are able to reach both goals. —Zekent_

**GIFT OF FIRE**

* Burst heal changed from **55-70-85-100-130 + 80% CR** to **60-80-100-120-160 + 65% CR.**

**SAW**

_We are trying to maintain SAW in the meta without him being unbeatable early and too vulnerable late. Adjusting his scaling armor allows us to have him break even around level six. —Zekent_

* Base armor and shield changed from **20-64** to **8-76** at level 1-12.

![header\_item\_changes\_new](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/header_item_changes_new1.png)

**FROSTBURN  
**

This item provided too much utility and crystal power for its low cost. —SurpriseBirthday

* Total cost up from **2400** gold to **2600.**

**HOME SCREEN IMPROVEMENTS**

* The most prominent news is now displayed on the app home screen.

**END-OF-MATCH SURVEY**

* A quick new survey will sometimes ask you how a match went. We’ll use your feedback to further improve the Matchmaker.

![header\_performance\_improvements\_new](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/header_performance_improvements_new.png)

#### **BUG FIXES**

* Adagio’s Gift of Fire slow duration text fixed to say **0.7** seconds. \(Ability not changed.\)
* Taka’s X-Retsu no longer skips the wind-up animation.
* Heroes in certain conditions will path more efficiently to targets.
* Ability overlays can be dismissed while silenced.

_Go try out the new 1.15 balance changes and enjoy the amazing new skins!_
