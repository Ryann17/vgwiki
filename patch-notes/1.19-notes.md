#### **GET BIG REWARDS ALL SUMMER LONG**

However you like to play, Summer is going to pump out rewards that get better and better as you make progress. In Update 1.19, you’ll find a new tab within your player profile called SEASON. Inside, you’ll find new Summer Chest you can open every day filled with awesomeness. Plus, this chest will rank up with you for better and better loot. That’s just the beginning. You can **collect Sunlight to boost your rewards** and get **bonus Sunlight from wearing skins in matches.** Be sure to read the full article!

#### **SUMMER GAMEPLAY CHANGES: INTRODUCING NEW ITEMS & AMBIENT GOLD **

Starting in Summer season, you’ll have much more build freedom and diversity. That’s because in addition to a number of new items and revamped build paths, roam players no longer need to buy Ironguard Contract first. That’s right; the Ironguard mechanic is now “always-on” without a shop purchase. Plus, there are changes to experience range as well as gold range & trickle rate. We strongly suggest you read up on the Summer changes since it will affect every match you play!

#### **SUMMER SEASON HALCYON FOLD MAP**

![lyra\_splash](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lyra_splash.jpg)

#### **NEW ROAM HERO: LYRA**

Lyra uses healing and protective magic to turn enemy positions into powerful zones for her allies. Utility and defense items improve her role as a healer, while crystal items provide a devastating-but-fragile mage path.

#### **LYRA EARLY-ACCESS PERIOD**

**Lyra will be unlockable with ICE only for the first 7 days.** Afterward, you will be able to unlock her with ICE or Glory.

![header\_features\_new](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/header_features_new.png)

**PRINCIPLE ARCANUM \(HEROIC PERK\)**

Lyra’s attacks are arcane missiles, dealing crystal damage. If she holds her ground after releasing an attack, she automatically channels and releases a much stronger arcane missile that deals additional crystal damage and briefly slows its target. Each channeled missile consumes energy, but Lyra can continue using these even if she runs out of energy.

**IMPERIAL SIGIL \(A\)**

Lyra forms a sigil at the target location, revealing surrounding enemies. While this sigil remains active, it heals nearby allied heroes and damages nearby enemy heroes. Lyra can reactivate this ability at any time to detonate the sigil, dealing heavy damage to surrounding enemies while providing a burst of healing and a moderate move speed boost to nearby allies.

**BRIGHT BULWARK \(B\)**

After a brief delay, Lyra releases a pulse of magical energy, damaging and applying a decaying slow to surrounding enemies. The affected area then becomes a walled zone of protection that deals the same damage and slow to enemies attempting to cross its borders. Enemies inside the zone are snared, allowing them to move normally but preventing them from using movement abilities.

**ARCANE PASSAGE \(C\)**

Lyra blinks to the target location, leaving portals at both the beginning and the end of the blink. Portals last for a few seconds, allowing allied and enemy heroes to move freely between them in both directions. Heroes must wait several seconds before they can re-enter a portal. This cooldown is also applied to enemies when Lyra hits them with the initial pulse of Bright Bulwark.

**QUEST TIMERS**

Sometimes, a local Internet issue can result in a frustrating play experience. This new persistent ping indicator will give you a better sense of the connection quality you’re getting from your local router and ISP. Note: While this will indicate where things generally stand, it can’t predict local ping spikes. We hope this helps! If you notice you have higher-than-expected local lag, try these tips:

* [Android connection tips](https://superevil.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207740905-I-am-experiencing-lag-what-can-I-do-)

#### **HERO PRICE NORMALIZATIONS**

The following heroes have ICE & Glory price increases in Update 1.19: Koshka, Petal, Catherine & Glaive. However, these changes will allow us to include these heroes in future sales, events and special bundles in ways we could not previously.

### NEW ITEMS COMING IN SUMMER UPDATE 1.19

_The other major reason for more build flexibility is more item choice! _

#### NEW CONTRACT ITEMS

With the introduction of Ambient Gold, Ironguard Contract is no longer a staple item for every roam build. Instead, a few early-game options have been introduced into the OTHER section in the item shop. These can grant a significant amount of power early on, or if you find the need for a small power boost at any given time for a fairly low cost, these new Contract items are fantastic options. However, keep in mind that none of these Contracts upgrades into anything, though they can be sold back for half the purchase cost.

![Items\_ironguard](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Items_ironguard.png)

**IRONGUARD CONTRACT**

Ironguard is now specifically geared toward coming out of the jungle with a bit more battle readiness and to keep both members of a jungle duo topped off to fend off invasions. While no longer a necessity, Ironguard still makes for a fantastic starting purchase.

* Passive: When a nearby ally kills a jungle monster, you both heal for **75** health Range: **14m**
* Cost: **300 **gold

![Items\_protector](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Items_protector.png)

**PROTECTOR CONTRACT**

A much more defensive start, the Protector Contract allows you to protect your teammates — as long as you are close enough to do so. This is a fantastic purchase if you expect heavy aggression coming out from the opposing team or if you plan on team fighting early on.

* Activate: Grant a **120 **health barrier to the nearest ally hero for **2 **seconds. **5s **cooldown. **2 **max charges, **20s** per charge. Range: **8m**
* Cost: **300 **gold

![Items\_dragonblood](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Items_dragonblood.png)

**DRAGONBLOOD CONTRACT**

The Dragonblood Contract supports early aggression and may allow you to dominate early on in a match; however, this initial advantage falls off very quickly. Having a fairly long recharge time and a fixed amount of damage, it is a great tool for early aggression and calculated ganks, but it is a good candidate to replace once mid-game rolls around.

* Activate: After a brief delay, nearby enemy heroes are marked for **3 **seconds. The next basic attack from an ally consumes the mark, slowing by **30% **for **2s** and dealing **75 **bonus crystal damage. **15s** cooldown. **2 **max charges, **40s** per charge. Range: **4m**
* Cost: **300 **gold

#### NEW UTILITY ITEMS & REWORKS

![stormguard-banner](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/stormguard-banner.png)

**STORMGUARD BANNER**

Stormguard Banner has been reworked to be a strong pickup for heroes who have weak wave/jungle clear abilities and for teams who intend to prioritize objective control over constantly battling the enemy team. However, this does come with the caveat that you will be giving up a significant amount of combat power.

* Passive: After using an ability, your next** 3** basic attacks in the next **6 **seconds deal **75** bonus true damage to non-heroes or **20 **to heroes. Can only be refreshed once every **6** seconds.
* **+2.5 **Energy Recharge
* **+150 **Energy
* Energy Battery \(**300**\) + Recipe \(**800**\) = **1100**

**STORMCROWN**

An upgraded version of the new Stormguard Banner. Deals significant but not overwhelming damage to heroes, but it’s fantastic for quickly taking down objectives.

**WAR TREADS \(WARHORN IS NOW A TYPE OF BOOTS\)**

These new boots have replaced Warhorn has a team-wide mobility option. If you ever find yourself in the situation where you need to get your team into or out of a fight quickly, War Treads is a perfect purchase.

* * Activate: Nearby allies Sprint for **2** seconds \(**60s **cooldown\).
  * Passive: **+0.4** Movement speed
  * Passive: Travel Boots
  * **+500 **Health
  * Stormguard passive removed
  * Travel Boots \(**1000**\) + Dragonheart \(**650**\) + Recipe **850**\) = **2500**

![Items\_halcyon\_chargers](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Items_halcyon_chargers.png)

**HALCYON CHARGERS**

A powerful new option for both running down your foes or escaping from a pursuer. Halcyon Chargers should easily be able to get you in or out of danger once. Choose this over Journey boots when prioritizing ability usage from cooldown speed.

* * Activate: Sprint for **3** seconds \(**50s** cooldown\).
  * Passive: **+0.5** Movement speed
  * Passive: Travel Boots
  * **+200 **Health
  * **+15% **Cooldown Speed

* **Activate: Fire a Flare at target location. \(18s **cooldown\).

* Oakheart \(**300**\) + Recipe \(**300**\) = **600**

![contraption](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/contraption.png)

**CONTRAPTION**

No longer building out of Stormguard Banner, Contraption now charges a bit faster and offers a bit more defensive power.

* **Cooldown up from 3 **to **5 **seconds \(**18s** per charge\)
* **+350 **Health
* **+35% **Cooldown Speed
* **+3 **Energy Recharge
* Health Regen removed
* Stormguard passive removed
* New Recipe: Flare Gun \(**600**\) + Chronograph \(**800**\) + Recipe \(**700**\) = **2100**

* Players may no longer walk into the area where the Jungle Shop resides.
* Tap area of the jungle shop has been decreased to avoid accidental shopping during fights.

“Skaarf was applying too much hidden damage with Fan the Flames, so we’re adjusting to make it more clear where the damage is coming from.” —Zekent

_“Adagio was a bit too powerful when paired with an attack speed oriented ally.” —Zekent_

**AGENT OF WRATH**

* Only buffs the next **4-4-4-4-6 basic attacks.**

**VERSE OF JUDGEMENT**

* Damage changed from **450-750-1050 + 140% CP** to **500-900-1300 + 100% CP**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/saw.png)

**SAW**

_“In 1.19, we made a change to SAW’s animations so that he moves more fluidly while spun up. Essentially, he continues to face his target while stutter stepping rather than rapidly turning back and forth, which looks much better. While this might throw people off at first, it’s almost purely a visual change and nothing about SAW’s stutter step timing has changed. Players will just need to mentally adjust to the new visual cues.” —AWAL_

**ANIMATIONS**

* SAW’s movement while Spun Up is more fluid. This appears different when stutter stepping.
* Nothing about SAW’s stutter-step timing has changed.
