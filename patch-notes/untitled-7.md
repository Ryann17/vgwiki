#### **NEW HERO: VARYA**



Varya is an electric valkyrie who devastates enemies by chaining together her abilities to deliver massive damage. Call upon her ultimate, Anvil’s Hammer, to unleash a series of lightning strikes on every enemy hero, no matter where they are on the map.

Varya is unlockable with ICE only for the first seven days. Afterward, you will be able to unlock her with ICE or Glory.

#### **HERO ABILITIES**



![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Perk_varya_chain_lightning-150x150.jpg) **CHAIN LIGHTNING \(HEROIC PERK\)**

Varya’s attacks deal crystal damage. If Varya holds her ground after attacking, she will strike her target and additional enemies with a bolt of Chain Lightning. This bolt deals the same damage and consumes energy.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/A_icon_varya_lightning_bolt-150x150.jpg)**STORMFORGED SPEAR \(A\)**

Varya throws a lightning spear that deals damage to the first enemy hero hit. The lightning will then bounce to nearby enemies dealing damage. Stormforged Spear has a reduced cast time when used during or after Arc Recursion.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/B_icon_varya_Charge_dash-1-150x150.jpg)**ARC RECURSION \(B\)**

After gathering power, Varya’s next two move commands will instantly dash in the chosen direction, dealing damage to nearby enemies upon arrival. Varya gains energy and some of her health as barrier for each enemy hit. Varya can cancel this early to dash a single time.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/C_icon_varya_Lightning_storm-150x150.jpg)**ANVIL’S HAMMER \(ULTIMATE\)**

After channeling, Varya calls down a series of lightning strikes on all enemy heroes, dealing damage per hit.

Ranking up this ability increases Varya’s attack speed and the number of enemies struck by Chain Lightning and Stormforged Spear.

#### **HERO TALENTS**



![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rare_talent_varya_lightning_bolt-150x150.jpg)**LONG STRIKE \(RARE\)**

Stormforged Spear \(A\) deals more damage and stuns on impact.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Epic_talent_varya_static_barrier-1000x1000.jpg)**STATIC BARRIER \(EPIC\)**

Arc Recursion \(B\) grants additional barrier and charges up more quickly.

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/legendary_talent_varya_thunderstorm-1000x1000.jpg)

**THUNDERSTORM \(LEGENDARY\)**

Anvil’s Hammer \(Ult\) delivers two additional strikes and no longer has reduced damage for consecutive hits.

#### **NEW SEASONAL MODE: THE ONSLAUGHT BEGINS**



At the heart of any MOBA is teamfighting action. Players want to feel like superstars — where they’ve unlocked a hero’s full power and their ultimate potential as a gamer — and those rare moments when everything comes together are pure magic. You know you can do no wrong. You’re carrying your team, and you know that your teammates are marveling at your skill. The only complaint a MOBA player has in times like these is they wish they weren’t so rare.

Enter “Onslaught,” a new Vainglory short BRAWL game mode where two teams of three players lock horns in escalating rounds of intense, tight-quarters combat. Each round, the stakes are raised, with more gold to spend and new superpowered Talents from which to choose. And because it’s ALL action, your true teamfighting skill emerges nearly every match.

For players who don’t have time for a full 20-minute MOBA match and players who just want short bursts of intense fun, Onslaught will be the new fan favorite.

#### THREE EASY STEPS

_Onslaught’s round-based play is broken down into three parts:_

**1. SELECT YOUR TALENT**

Each round, you _can_ select one talent for the hero you’re playing. Selecting a talent in a round exhausts it; you cannot select it in another round of that Onslaught match.

**2. SPEND YOUR GOLD**

Each round, you’ll be granted gold along with any gold unspent from prior rounds of the match. Buy items to be stronger in the inevitable teamfights to follow!

**3. HIT ‘READY’ … THEN FIGHT!**

Once you’ve selected your talent and spent your gold, indicate that you’re ready for the next round. Once all players have hit “ready” the round will start. _Note: If you take too long, the round will start anyway, so don’t ponder the options too long!_ You only get one life each round \(no respawning\), so make it count!

#### NOWHERE TO HIDE

If you’ve read this far and are thinking, “I’ll just play a stealth hero and hide the whole match,” well, we thought of that, too. Over time, the play area will shrink, forcing players to fight to the death. There’s no escape from the onslaught.

#### DEEPER STRATEGY LURKS WITHIN

_While plenty of BRAWL players will casually enjoy Onslaught’s action, there is a wellspring of strategic decision-making just beneath the surface:_

* **You can deliberately save unspent gold** for a bigger bounty to spend next round. Any unspent gold from the previous round will **accrue interest** for the next one. You’ll be weaker for one round, but you’ll then have an unexpected power spike that others don’t.
* **You can strategically select \(or opt-out\) of talents each round.** Because there are five rounds per match, you’ll only have a talent buff in at most three rounds, and that’s if you have the Rare, Epic and Legendary talents for that hero. You’ll need to decide when you want to be strong, when you can afford to be weaker, and which talent is most important to use when. _Should you use your Legendary talent early to balance out lack of items … or should you wait for a big bang of power in the late stages of the onslaught?_ And since every hero has radically different talents, these decisions vary not just from round to round, but also hero to hero.
* **Your Five-hero Chest just became a thing.** In order to maximize your power each match, you’ll need the Rare, Epic and Legendary talents for your hero of choice. Remember: Playing any public game mode with a hero will count toward your Five-hero Chest, and once you’ve completed matches with five different heroes, that chest will pay out with a random combination of Rare, Epic and Legendary talents. This is a great \(and free\) way to expand your talents collection and give you more options in more rounds of Onslaught combat.

_Onslaught is a seasonal BRAWL game mode being introduced for Vainglory’s Winter season start. Also in the works is Vainglory’s long-requested, long-awaited 5v5 mode, which will be unveiled during the 2017 Vainglory World Championship Dec. 14-17. If you haven’t pre-registered for Vainglory 5v5, _[_do it now_](https://5v5.vainglorygame.com/)_ to get a chance at early 5v5 access and to get the Founding 5v5 player badge! — PlayoffBeard _

#### **GOLDEN TICKET: SECURE YOUR SPOT IN VAINGLORY 5V5 BEFORE ANYONE ELSE**

![](https://jd3sljkvzi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/goldenticket_article.jpg) 

Vainglory 5V5 will be globally unveiled at the World Championship on Dec. 17, with superior gameplay and strategic depth, the most accurate and responsive controls and the best graphics and highest frame rates on mobile. It’s the completion of a dream that began back in 2014 — long before mobile devices existed that could handle the scope and scale of our ultimate vision.

But those devices and technology are now here, and the unveiling moment is fast approaching. Afterward, one clear question will ring out over and over again: _“When can I play it?”_

The answer depends on your luck … and your determination.

Before anyone else enters Vainglory 5V5, a fortunate few will achieve Early Access by virtue of something new: Golden Tickets.

#### WHAT IS A GOLDEN TICKET?

**Golden Tickets are the only guaranteed entry system into Vainglory 5V5 Early Access.** If you have a Golden Ticket, you will be among the first people ever to set foot on the new map and experience its wonders … and dragons.

#### HOW DO I GET A GOLDEN TICKET?

_You can acquire a Golden Ticket in multiple ways, and you’re welcome to participate in any or all options:_

* **Pre-register for Vainglory 5V5 for a chance at Early Access.** This enters you into a lottery from which Golden Ticket winners will be drawn. We will conduct multiple drawings, so you have multiple chances of being randomly selected for a Golden Ticket. There’s no downside to this, so [pre-register now](https://5v5.vainglorygame.com/) and also get the “Founding 5V5” player badge as a result.
* **Every quest you complete beginning Dec. 17 could pay out a Golden Ticket.** Immediately following the World Championship, when you complete a quest, there’s a small chance that the chest you open will contain a Golden Ticket.
* **Special holiday-themed boxes \(arriving Dec. 17\).** We wanted to include a way to honor those who support Vainglory through premium box purchases. And while the odds of getting a Golden Ticket in these boxes will be quite low, they will be loaded with amazing content that makes every pull very worthwhile, whether you luck into a Golden Ticket or not.

No matter what methods you choose, finding a Golden Ticket will be a rare, special occurrence, so if you succeed, count yourself lucky and congratulations!

#### DREAMS BECOME REALITY

We are so thrilled to bring this 5V5 dream to life, which belongs as much to Vainglory’s players as our dev team. From the very beginning, we’ve believed that every phone was a portable next-gen console, and that every mobile player deserved games just as core, strategic and performant as players on PC. Vainglory 5V5 speaks to the heart of what Super Evil Megacorp stands for, and our 5V5 MOBA will be deeply strategic and tactical, with console-grade performance, based on deep, original fantasy storytelling.

We’ll see you during the global unveiling of Vainglory 5V5 at Worlds, and afterward, happy Golden Ticket hunting! With a little luck, you’ll be playing 5v5 before everyone else!

#### **WINTER SEASON: A FRESH START AHEAD OF THE NEW YEAR**



Each Vainglory season is a fresh challenge with new dynamics. Resetting players’ rank gives all players a chance to advance every season and show their true skill in an ever-evolving meta.

Like last season, we’re granting all players bonus progress on their Winter rank based on prior Ranked performance for a head start.

* Your Autumn rank is now immortalized in your profile’s Trophy Case.
* See your best Autumn rank along with your allies’ on the Ranked match loading screen.

#### **HEROES BALANCE**



**ALPHA**

_“It’s great to finally see more Alpha play, but with the new Dragon’s Eye, Infinite Reboot is reaching some pretty crazy numbers. In addition, the increased energy regen on some items meant players were hitting the cap a bit easier than intended. This change is to ensure the enemy team has a fair chance to stop her reboot.” —Nivmett_

**INFINITE REBOOT**

* Minimum reboot time increased from **2.0** to **2.5**

**PRIME DIRECTIVE**

* Crystal ratio reduced from **200%** to **180%**
* Crystal ratio per stack reduced from **40%**to **30%**

**ARDAN**

_“_Ardan has been a top pick for the past few updates, especially with the new health changes. While we love the plays that were made, the Echo and Gauntlet combo was unhealthy for the game on a number of levels. First, while seeing the Venn diagram was really cool, the possibility of as many as FOUR Gauntlets on the screen at once in a Casual mode could explode low-end devices. Second, in terms of gameplay, carving up a teamfight into tiny safe areas was oppressive, and there’s no amount of Reflex Blocks that could keep the experience from feeling terrible for other players.

“These changes will lower his durability. In addition, we have lowered the damage that support Ardan deals while dusting off his old weapon build._”  —Nivmett_

**STATS**

* Health reduced from **878-2738** to **838-2638**

**BLOOD FOR BLOOD**

* Increased bonus damage percent from **25%** to **40%**
* Damage reduced from **40/90/140/190/240** to **40/80/120/160/200**

**GAUNTLET**

* Activating Gauntlet while another Gauntlet is on the map will immediately remove the older Gauntlet. This specifically addresses the double Gauntlet interaction with Echo, which introduced unintended confusion and a great deal of stress on device performance.

**BARON**

_“It’s great to see more Crystal Baron, but he was dealing too much damage.” —Nivmett_

**PORCUPINE MORTARS**

* Crystal ratio reduced from **190%** to **170%**

**ION CANNON**

* Cooldown reduced from **90/75/60** to **80/65/50**

**BAPTISTE**

_“Baptiste was benefiting greatly from the new Clockwork. This change reduces how much he can spam Ordained.” —Nivmett_

**ORDAINED**

* Cooldown increased from **16/15/14/13/12** to **17/16/15/14/13**

**BLACKFEATHER**

_“Blackfeather’s durability was a touch too high.” —Nivmett_

**ON POINT**

* Health ratio down from **13%** to **12%**

**CELESTE**

_“Celeste has enjoyed the new item energy changes greatly. While it’s fun that she’s able to use her abilities more freely, the impact her supernova had was not proportional to its availability.” —Nivmett_

**HELIOGENESIS**

* Supernova crystal ratio reduced from **220%** to **200%**

**FLICKER**

_“This change will allow for Flicker players to cloak their team much more quickly.” —Nivmett_

**MOONCLOAK**

* Time before stealth duration from **1.2** to **0.8**

**GLAIVE**

_“A change that returns more of Glaive’s built-in tankiness._

**STATS**

* Health increased from **784-2453** to **834-2503**

**GRACE**

_“Grace needed a slight buff to bring her more in line with other captains.” —Nivmett_

**STATS**

* Increased armor and shield from **20-60** to **20-70**

**BENEDICTION**

* Holy Shield damage reduction increased from **30%** to **40%**

**HOLY NOVA**

* Energy cost reduced from **125** to **100**

**IDRIS**

_“Idris is a carry who suffered greatly from the Update 2.10 health changes. These buffs will allow him to deal the damage he needs to.” —Nivmett_

**DIVERGENT PATHS**

* Crystal ratio increased from **90%** to **100%**

**SHROUDSTEP**

* Damage amp increased from **10/15/20/25/35%** to **25/30/35/40/50%**

**JOULE**

_“Joule’s crystal path has been updated!” —Nivmett  
_

**THUNDER STRIKE**

* Crystal ratio increased from **135%** to **160%**

**BIG RED BUTTON**

* Crystal ratio increased from **300%** to **350%**

**KOSHKA**

_“A bit of love for everyone’s favorite cat.” —Nivmett  
_  
 **POUNCY FUN**

* Damage increased from **75/130/185/240/350** to **80/140/200/260/380**

**TWIRLY DEATH**

* Crystal ratio increased from **80%** to **90%**

**KRUL**

_“The changes to Shiversteel and Spellsword allowed Krul to feast on his enemies.” —Nivmett  
_  
 **SPECTRAL SMITE**

* Damage per stack reduced from **20/35/50/65/95** to **20/30/40/50/70**

**LORELAI**

_“Lorelai had the best of both worlds, so we made changes to differentiate her support and carry paths by adding health scaling to her stun, slow and shield. We also lowered her base damages but increased ratios._

_So what do these changes mean? If you play Lorelai as a captain, you’ll be rewarded with stronger crowd control by having more health in your build. In fact, if you hit about 1500 bonus health, you will hit the cap on her A and B skills. On the flipside, those who play her as a carry will have less crowd control at their disposal but will deal greater damage with crystal items.” —Nivmett  
_

**THAT’S SWELL**

* Crystal ratio on basic attacks increased from **60%** to **70%**

**FISH FOOD**

* Stun duration reduced from **1 second** to **0.45 seconds**
* Health ratio added to stun duration of **0.03%** bonus health
* Cooldown increased from **10/9.5/9/8.5** to **12/11.5/11/10.5/10**
* Damage per second decreased from **55/105/155/205/305** to **55/95/135/175/255**
* Crystal ratio on damage per second increased from **90%** to **110%**

**SPLASHDOWN**

* Cooldown increased from **7.5/7/6.5/6/5** to **8/7.5/6/6.5/5.5**
* Slow decreased from **25/30/35/40/45%** to **25%**
* Health ratio added to slow of 0.017% of Lorelai’s bonus health \(cap of 50%\)

**WATERWALL**

* Added a health ratio of **15%** \(Needs 1333 to return to full strength\)
* Barrier reduced from **500/750/1000** to **400/600/800**
* Crystal ratio reduced from **150%** to **100%**

**LYRA**

_“Lyra has been a top pick because of her incredible kit since her release. These changes lower her overwhelming power as a captain and give a bit of love to her carry path.”  —Nivmett_

**PRINCIPLE ARCANUM**

* Crystal ratio on initial basic attack increased from **50%** to **60%**

**IMPERIAL SIGIL**

* Burst heal reduced from **60%** to **50%**
* Speed boost reduced from **2.0** to **1.5**
* Health ratio reduced from **13%** to **11%**

**REIM**

_“While we did tone down Reim quite a lot, we tuned a bit extra for safety’s sake. This is to give him back a little power, mainly in the areas that make him the intended crystal bruiser he is and not a super-burst bruiser.” —Nivmett_

* Weapon ratio reduced from 175% to 160%
* Fortified health per level from 60/100/140 to 60/95/130

#### **ITEMS BALANCE**



\(need a smaller dragons eye image\)**DRAGON’S EYE**  
 _“Dragon’s Eye is a great item because of its ability to create pressure. It also gives crystal carries the chance to close out fights against tanky teams. These changes will make Dragon’s Eye more accessible as its stacking is similar to the old Broken Myth.” —Nivmett_

* Time before stacks begin to drop increased from **2.5** to **4**
* Crystal per stack reduced from **20** to **15**
