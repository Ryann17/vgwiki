![Chain Lightning](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

Varya's attacks deal 55-132 \(level 1-12\) \(+45% crystal power\) crystal damage. If Varya holds her ground after attacking, she will strike her target & up to 3 additional enemies with a bolt of Chain Lightning. This bolt deals the same damage & consumes 170 energy.

## Ability A: Stormforged Spear

![Stormforged Spear](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28185%29.png)

Varya throws a spear at lightning speed, striking the first enemy in its path. This deals a burst of damage to the target & chains additional damage to nearby targets.

* When cast during or after Arc Recursion, the spear is thrown more quickly.
* Number of additional targets hit is equal to her Chain Lightning attack.

## Ability B: Arc Recursion

![Arc Recursion](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28113%29.png)

After gathering power for 0.9s, Varya's next two move commands will instantly dash in the chosen direction, striking the 3 nearest enemies at the end of each dash. For each enemy struck, Varya recovers 5% of her energy & gains a barrier equal to 3% of her health \(bonuses doubled on heroes\).

* Overdrive: Varya moves further with each dash.
* Varya can dash at any time, but will only dash once if she has not fully charged.
* Varya can activate Stormforged Spear at any time during this ability. Any remaining dashes will trigger after the spear is thrown.
* Deals 50% less damage to minions.

## Ultimate: Anvil's Hammer

![Anvil&apos;s Hammer](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29.png)

After channeling for 2.4s, Varya unleashes the fury of the storm, calling a series of lightning strikes on every enemy hero, regardless of distance. Passively, each rank of the ultimate permanently increases her attack speed & the number of enemies her Chain Lightning & Stormforged Spear will hit.

* Lightning strikes target the ground beneath enemy heroes, giving them an opportunity to move out of the way.
* Lightning strikes deal 75% reduced damage to enemies already hit by lightning in the same wave.
* Varya can break out of channeling early by activating Stormforged Spear or Arc Recursion. This does not cancel the spell.
* Deals 50% less damage to minions.
