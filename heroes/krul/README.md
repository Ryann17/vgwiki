Krul detonates the Weakness stacks built up on a single target, regaining health based on the number of stacks consumed.

* Passive: Basic attacks & abilities apply Weakness on the enemy \(up to 8 stacks\). Each stack reduces the target's damage by 6.2% & increases Krul's lifesteal against the victim.

## Ultimate: From Hell's Heart

![From Hell&apos;s Heart](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2838%29.png)

Krul pulls Hellrazor from his chest & hurls it in the targeted direction. The sword will boomarang back to Krul. If the sword hits an enemy hero, it deals damage & stuns, then slows the target.

Damage & stun duration scales with the distance the sword travelled before hitting the target:

* 50% at point-blank range
* 100% at max range
* 150% at 'boomerang' range
