# Steer clear of the charged crystals

 Charged-up crystals can mean only one thing: Churn. You don’t know why the dwarves are messing with Churn energy, but you won’t be a part of it. You march back to the Sanctuary just in time to see an airship careen through the clouds and land hard on the cobbles, giggling goblins rolling off the deck. Just the thing you needed to get out of here!
