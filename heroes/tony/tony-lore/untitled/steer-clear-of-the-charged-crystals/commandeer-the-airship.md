# Commandeer the airship

#### 'SKY CAPTAIN'

“Alright, listen up!” The goblins aboard the airship are so distracted with arguing and picking one another’s noses that you must bop the nearest one on the head so that the others will listen. “I’m the captain of this ship now, and you are my faithful mates.”

“Aye aye, Cap’n!” scream the goblins.

“There will be gold!”

“Yay!” the goblins yell.

“There will be adventure!”

“Yay!”

There will be bloody battles!”

“Yay!”

“Off we go!”

“Where!”

You gulp, having not considered that part yet. “S… South!” you stutter.

“Yay!” cries the crew, scrambling to their positions.

The ship shoots straight up, sending your stomach up into your throat, then lurches around the sharp mountain crags, birds escaping the engines by the smallest of margins. Off to the south you go, one foot up on the prow, where you will seek treasure and discover adventure and fail in the Battle of the Sky Captains, which of course you know all about.

**THE END**
