## Ultimate: Wait for It...

Vox fires an ultrasonic wave that applies Resonance to enemies in its path. Shortly after, a wide shockwave explodes along the same path, dealing crystal damage & silencing enemies.

* Striking enemy heroes with the shockwave will also cause Resonance Bolts to bounce outward to other enemies.
