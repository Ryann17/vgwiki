# Grumpjaw Lore

## ‘CHEESECAKE’

![Uhhh smellll baddd.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2862%29.png)

“See what people get wrong is,” says the dwarf, “time travel isn’t about time at all. It’s about

_speed_

. Open up.”

The dwarf hoists a steel barrel half his size overhead and the chains shackled to Grumpjaw’s massive horns and neck clank as his jaw drops.

Grumpjaw is hungry. This is not new. Grumpjaw is always hungry. He wakes up hungry and at night, his belly growls. It’s his job to swallow whatever leftovers and waste are given to him, a living trash truck. He likes cabbages and corn-with-the-cob, and rabbit stew and boar bacon, which sometimes the guards throw out. He likes things that aren’t food, like shoes, which have chewy bits and laces that floss between his teeth. He loves a well-aged blue cheese, and strawberry cake, which he tasted once after the warden’s birthday.

Out of the barrel pours a green, glowy goo that Grumpjaw gulps until it’s gone. “BLEH,” says Grumpjaw.

“Putrid,” says the dwarf.

“POOTED,” agrees Grumpjaw.

“Shame this correctional facility treats you like a trash disposal. Even prisoners have rights, you know. You ever had pie? You look like a pie man.”

“CAKE,” says Grumpjaw.

“When we get out of here, I’ll make you a cake every year on your birthday.”

“OUT?”

“Try not to breathe,” says the dwarf, and lifts up another barrel.

Grumpjaw opens his maw wide and squinches his nostrils shut. The toxic goo spills down his gullet, making his big belly hang.

The dwarf kicks the empty barrel aside. His arrogance makes him resplendent in his blinding orange prison uniform. He’s the biggest small man Grumpjaw has ever seen, always bragging about his genius genes, his many inventions and working for some queen or another, which landed him in prison when things went wrong. Most of all, the dwarf isn’t afraid, not of the guards, or the goo, not even of Grumpjaw. Then again, Grumpjaw is a docile guy, despite his size and his tusks, as long as he isn’t hungry for too long.

“I made the mistake at first of moving within the dimension of time, backward and forward,” continues the dwarf. “I put my cousin in the apparatus and sent him forward two minutes. He disappeared, then showed up two minutes later, freeze-dried. Took some math to figure out that the planet’s moving, and fast, so he’d been floating out in space until the planet caught up to the present time.” The dwarf leans up against Grumpjaw’s haunch. “Are you understanding any of this?”

“SOME,” says Grumpjaw.

“Good, because this involves you.”

At this, Grumpjaw’s little ears perk up. Nothing has ever involved him before.

“Time is about speed and gravity. Control those two things and you control time. And space. And whatever you want. You can_go\_wherever you want. Or\_whenever_.”

“OUT?” asks Grumpjaw.

From the loudspeaker comes the booming voice of a guard: “Keep it moving, dwarf.”

“I have a name!” yells the dwarf, shaking his fist.

“FRANKIE,” says Grumpjaw.

“That’s right, buddy.” The dwarf gives Grumpjaw a scratch behind his ear, which feels nice. Grumpjaw bites into one of the barrels and slurps up the goo. It’s gross, but it’s_something_. “I’ve always wondered – is your name Grumpjaw, or is that what your species is called?”

“YES,” says Grumpjaw.

“Alright. Anyway, it’s about speed, and trapping light inside gravity. It should be called time_dilation_. And I made it. I call it:_The Cube_.”

“COOB,” says Grumpjaw.

“But my prototype squashes everyone I try it on.” Frankie’s meaty hands slap down on one another,_bam_. “And that’s why I need you to swallow me.”

“NO.”

“Not forever,” says Frankie with clipped irritation. “Just until we’re out. All we need to do is get my cube from the warden, then you’ll swallow me down, and The Cube will take us through time and space, and you will cough me up again, and I shall make you a cake.”

“CHEESE.”

“I thought you said you wanted cake.”

“CHEESECAKE.”

“That’s patently ridiculous,” scoffs Frankie, stepping up onto Grumpjaw’s back to avoid the toxic goo spilling out from Grumpjaw’s barrel. “Whoever heard of a cake made of cheese?”

Grumpjaw whips his horns around and roars, clattering the chains, knocking Frankie off and into the toxic waste spill. Frankie scrambles to his feet and combs his beard with his fingers.

“Okay okay,” he grumbles. “I’m an engineer. I can engineer a cake of cheese.”

“CHEESECAKE,” sighs Grumpjaw.

## ‘OUT’ {#GrumpjawPart2}

![Boop.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2829%29.png)

“Right then,” says Frankie, “after you.”

“CAN’T.” Grumpjaw shakes his head, jingling the chains that hold his collar to the walls.

“Oh, that.” Frankie grips one of the chains, inspecting it. “Looks like carbon grade 30 – they never waste an opportunity to be cheap at this facility, do they? – and I’d guesstimate your weight at about 5000 pounds, so if you exert force at a rate of…” He draws the equation in the air with one finger, his lips moving without sound. “…per millimeter squared… carry the one and… yes. Snap them.”

With a shrug of Grumpjaw’s mighty shoulders and a swing of his thick neck, the chains snap apart and the broken links clink on the concrete floor.

“Right then,” repeats Frankie, motioning toward the heavy steel door. “After you.”

Grumpjaw backs up, dragging the broken chains along, then charges forward with a rumbly roar, crashing straight into the door and through it, bonking into the wall on the other side of the hall. Frankie strolls out of the room and jabs a thumb toward the guards standing frozen, mouths agape.

They don’t have time to scream. Grumpjaw swallows one whole, then another; their keys tickle his belly from the inside as he lumbers off after the dwarf, who whistles as he makes his way toward the warden’s office. Alarms wail and warnings blare from the loudspeakers:

ALL PRISONERS RETURN TO THEIR CELLS. A GRUMPJAW IS ON THE LOOSE. ALL PRISONERS RETURN TO THEIR CELLS.

Grumpjaw charges the door marked WARDEN. The door becomes stuck on Grumpjaw’s horns and must be wiggled off while the warden, a sharp-nosed man in a too-big suit, cowers under his desk.

“Hand over The Cube,” croons Frankie.

“COOB,” repeats Grumpjaw.

“Fine!” cries the warden as he unlocks a safe in the corner. “We couldn’t get the thing to work anyway – it’s a dud. And you’ll never get out alive. The prison is surrounded by armed guards.” He pulls out a steel box. ”I’ve given them the order to shoot this animal first!”

“He has a name,” says Frankie, snatching The Cube away from the warden.

“GRUMPJAW,” says Grumpjaw, peering at The Cube.

“That’s right, buddy. Okay, cough them up.”

With a disgusting retching sound, Grumpjaw hurks up the swallowed guards into a gasping, gooey pile. His growl discourages any heroism while Frankie pokes at The Cube, muttering under his breath until it hums. The six sides of The Cube pull apart and shoot across the room six ways, filling in between with light. Inside, a cube made of light spins, slow at first and then with increasing speed.

“OUT,” says Grumpjaw, and the guards and the warden comply, screaming as they slip and slide out of the room.

Frankie pokes at the glowing cube, directing the spin one way then the other. “6837.33 kilometers, north by northeast!” he yells as the humming grows louder. “Fifteen degrees, 182.6 days ago, the earth’s orbit was… carry the one…”

The light brightens. It hurts Grumpjaw’s eyes. He turns in nervous circles, knocking over the warden’s desk.

“Don’t worry, my friend! I’ve done the math in my head! This should take us right to the place and time when everything went wrong!”

“RONG?” whimpers Grumpjaw.

“All set!” Frankie jumps up and hangs off of Grumpjaw’s lower lip. “Gulp me down!”

Grumpjaw gulps Frankie down, careful not to chew, and the room fills with light, and the humming gets so loud that Grumpjaw’s little ears fold down, and the room spins…

…and then it is dark. The humming is gone. The warden’s office is gone too. It feels squeezy, like a very tight hug. The walls of The Cube are mirrors. There are Grumpjaws everywhere. Some of the Grumpjaws are newborn Grumpjaws, and some are young calf Grumpjaws, and some are like him but upside down, and some are very old and handsome Grumpjaws.

“GRUMPJAW?” asks all of the Grumpjaws.

And then The Cube is just a steel box again, sitting on the floor nearby. Grumpjaw is in a dark room, all alone.

_ding!_

A pair of elevator doors open in the center of the dark room. Calm music trills out through the speakers. Then there’s a fast rush of air and an empty elevator car crashes to the ground floor.

Something feels funny in Grumpjaw’s belly. Something wiggly.

“OH,” he says, and coughs up Frankie.

“Took your time!” coughs the dwarf, wiping a greenish splatter from his cheek.

“SORRY.”

Frankie combs the stomach goo out of his beard as he peers up through the elevator shaft at blue sparks falling down from high above. A bird screech echoes down. “I suppose I could have come a few minutes sooner.”

“CAKE?” asks Grumpjaw.

“Yes, my friend,” he says. “After I tend to a matter upstairs, there will be cake.”

### ‘LAPDOG’ GRUMPJAW

#### THE PROPER CARE AND FEEDING OF GRUMPJAW LAPDOGS

![Hungryyy.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2848%29.png)

The Grumpjaw Lapdog is a special breed with unique needs. Well cared-for Grumpjaws are so affectionate and loyal that their owners don’t even mind the loud snoring and farting. Grumpjaws get cold easily, so it is a good idea to get yours a nice hat and jacket for going outside in blustery weather.

**Feeding    
**  
Grumpjaws have strong muscles and big bellies that are impossible to keep full, so it is necessary to follow your veterinarian’s diet instructions and keep a lot of dog food around. Many Grumpjaw owners must build a shed or barn to hold all of the food, or they may find that they become the hangry doggy’s meal!

**Grooming    
**  
Grumpjaws are drooly and need lots of loving care. Their face wrinkles must be lifted and cleaned every day, and their bat ears and eyes checked for infection. Their teeth and tusks should be brushed at least once a week, or their bad breath will fog up your home. They love massages with their manicures. Their coats must only be bathed with gentle shampoos that retain the skin’s natural oils. If you are a small sort of person, you may need a system of ladders, ropes and pulleys to complete these tasks on your giant doggy.

**Training    
**  
Caring for Grumpjaws is much easier when they are trained as puppers. Grumpjaws aim to please, but they are also playful and stubborn. Teach them to be still during grooming, since chasing this breed around can result in broken lamps or frightened neighbor children. Potty training is of utmost importance! A little Grumpjaw accident means a BIG mess for its owner. For crate training, experts suggest a garage filled with your doggy’s favorite blankies. Chew toys and pulling ropes are not recommended, as a Grumpjaw will swallow them whole and suffer from bellyache.

**Socializing**

Grumpjaws love to go everywhere you go! Socialites are leading the way with fashion-forward motorized strollers and gem-encrusted leashes for transporting your Grumpjaw in style. Be aware that many shop owners will not welcome your doggy into their establishment, but adult Grumpjaws don’t fit through doorways anyway.

These lovable doggies are also big on cuddling and will climb onto your lap at every opportunity. Be careful, as this has resulted in broken femurs and pelvises among Grumpjaw owners!

### 'CARNIVORE' GRUMPJAW

#### ' **FURIOUS GRUMPJAW ATTACKS ON THE RISE'**

![Ughh die.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

 Beware the carnivorous jungle Grumpjaw! Those who manage to escape his four strong horn-lined jaws return gored and trampled, telling tales of an insatiable, hungry beast who runs much faster than his massive body appears. Reports of marauding Grumpjaws have increased in recent months. Nothing is safe: humans, sappy treants, animals and even small dragons have been swallowed whole. Even seasoned hunters are rendered defenseless. Locals are advised to travel in groups and never turn their backs on the jungle.
