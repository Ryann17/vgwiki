* This caps at 100 & decays when Rona has been out of combat for 5s.

A two-part axe attack that can catch up to - then brutalize - an unsuspecting target.

* First activation: Rona lunges at her target, landing an empowered basic attack & granting her increased move speed & Bloodrage.
* Second activation: Expend the bonus move speed & all of her Bloodrage to deal 1% bonus damage for each point consumed & apply Mortal Wounds to her target. She is then temporarily granted additional attack speed.
