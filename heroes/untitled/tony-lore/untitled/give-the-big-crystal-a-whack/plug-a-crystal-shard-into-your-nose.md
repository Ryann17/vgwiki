# Plug a crystal shard into your nose

If these things can power up a machine, what could they do to _you?_ You make sure no one’s looking before inserting a glowing shard into your nostril.

Solutions to equations that never made sense in math class appear in your mind, then burst into brilliant fireworks in colors you’ve never before seen. You understand, all at once, that everyone and everything is connected, and that love is the most important thing in the world. You wander off alone to contemplate existence.

**THE END**
