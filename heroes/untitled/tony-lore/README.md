## 'THE BEGINNING'

It’s been months since your power punchers slammed through the last of the rock to Mont Lille’s hollow center, and yellow TOP SECRET tape still criss-crosses the opening. You poke your head into the dank-smelling darkness.

“No, Tony.” The head engineer grips the back of your neck.

“C’mon, Pippa. I wanna see what’s in there,” you whine.

“Don’t get too big for your cargo shorts. Entrust this part of the operation to the _smart_dwarves. Besides,” she says, poking at your chest with rolled-up blueprints, “we need a demolition dwarf up on the Rise, tunneling _down_.”

“_Sweet!_” Most dwarves are scared to go up that high, but _you’re_ adventurous. You hustle up to the surface, Pippa’s blueprints under your arm, and head straight for the the long, winding mountain trail leading to Sovereign’s Rise.

The hike takes all day, so you take a rest at the Sanctuary. Over the edge, you can see the Storm Queen’s palace and capital city. You hock up a loogie, spit it out, and watch it fall.

Well, time to get to work. There are three paths stretching away from the Sanctuary.
