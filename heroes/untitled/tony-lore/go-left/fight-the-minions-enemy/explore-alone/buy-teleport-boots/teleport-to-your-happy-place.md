# Teleport to your happy place

#### 'THE HAPPY PLACE'

Your eyes close. Your mind clears. The world around you falls away as you think of your happy place. After a long moment, you realize it’s quiet and warm.

You open one eye.

A hammock under you swings with the gentle breeze. You’re on a sunny, balmy island covered with fine sand and palm trees. In your hand is a fruity drink with a little umbrella poking out. A squawking gull sails overhead.

Sovereign’s Rise is gone. Mont Lille is gone. No evil queens. No dwarves to boss you around, ever again.

You take the teleport boots off and throw them away forever.

**THE END**
