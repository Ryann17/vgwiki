# Create a reality show

You hide Cams in every bush and under every turret on the Rise. The ensuing footage is mostly boring – minions slaughtering one another, a river troll napping – but some of it is _gold_. You start the hit hidden camera show _Sovereign’s Spies_. On episode one, millions tune in to watch a snooty seraphim fall into the stream while admiring his reflection. Soon after comes the episode where a monkey fixes his wedgie, but the one where the undead viking guy argues with the old mage about whose back aches worse goes viral. Your ad revenue skyrockets and you become a worldwide star.

**THE END**
