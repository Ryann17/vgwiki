# Save yourself

#### 'SAVE YOURSELF!'

“I’m paid to dig holes, not clobber dragons,” you say, backing up. You race as fast as your short legs will take you all the way back down the mountain.

Back underground, you tell the others about the dragon. Saw it with your own eyes, you did, the _real thing.  
_  
“My mom always said,” you tell them, _“There’s all sorts of foolishness aboveground, and dwarves aren’t fools.”  
_  
You refuse to go back out there, no, never again. You gather together a band of dwarves who want nothing to do with wars and dragons and whatever mysterious thing hides under the mountain. The Undergrounders, you call yourselves, and together you defect from the engineers forever, spending your lives in pursuit of enlightenment and peace.

**THE END**
