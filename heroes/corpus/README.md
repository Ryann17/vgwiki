#### The Nightmare Goat.

## Heroic Perk: **Somnambulism**

![Somnambulism](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

 Enemies in close proximity to Corpus for more than 5 seconds fall into a dreaming trance for 2 seconds. This trance marks enemies, but they are otherwise unaffected until Corpus acts. Corpusâ€™ nightmare goat items & abilities are more frightening while enemies are asleep.

## Ability A: Bleating Shriek

 Corpus lets out a shriek that deals crystal damage in a short radius around him, applies a mortal wound to each target and refreshes the dream trance on enemies. Sleeping enemies receive 20% more damage from the shriek and goat power-infused items.

## Ability B: Horror Spiral

 Corpus gouges the target with his spiraled horns and sticks to the target while it moves for 2.2 seconds. Enemies may drag Corpus but cannot free themselves until the duration expires. Sleeping enemies receive 10% more damage from the gouge and goat power-infused items.

## Ultimate: Waking Nightmare

 Corpus plunges all sleeping enemies \(globally\) into a waking nightmare, causing them to lose control and attack the nearest ally for 3 seconds. A sleeping enemy with no ally nearby will inflict damage on itself for the duration of the nightmare. Following this duration, all enemies awaken \(trance removed\).
