* Instead of energy, Ardan uses a yellow meter called Vengeance.
* Because Ardan doesn't need regular energy, 5% of bonus energy & 50% of bonus energy recharge are converted to crystal power.

Arden dashes to protect an ally, granting them a 4s barrier & a burst of move speed. This also slows & damages nearby enemies.

* Overdrive: At max rank, Vanguard grants 30% Vengeance when cast on an ally.
* Using this ability on himself results in only half the barrier, speed boost & Vengeance gain.
* Barrier scales up with 30% of Ardan's bonus health.
* Any time this ally takes damage, Ardan gains Vengeance.
