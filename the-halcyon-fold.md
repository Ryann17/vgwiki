## The Map

The Halcyon Fold is the first map implemented into the game, featuring a three man-team play style. The map feature a single lane and a jungle extending from the rim of the lane to the bottom edge of the map. This map is available to play in Battle Royales, Blitz, Casual and Rank modes. However in Battle Royale mode, combat is limited to the lane and its surrounding features.

## The Base

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffM7KubWhpE\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Team Bases\",\"description\":\"Team bases are located on the left and right sides of the map Each team\'s base is home to the team\'s Vain crystal and sanctuary, as well as several turrets.\n\nYou\'ll begin each match in your sanctuary. Here you can shop, regenerate health and energy, and be protected from damage. You can always return to the sanctuary by tapping the Teleport Home button in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nThe Vain crystal becomes vulnerable to attacks once the nearby turrets have been taken down. If the Vain crystal itself is destroyed, the match will end in the attacker\'s favor.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffM7KubWhpE/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffM7KubWhpE?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffM7KubWhpE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

## The Lane

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNcMNBLLtF0\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"The Lane\",\"description\":\"The lane is the long stony path along the top of the map that connects both bases. Each team has constructed turrets to protect heroes and minions traveling along this path.\n\nKeep an eye on the golden ring at the center of the lane. During the first few minutes of a match, it\'s usually a good idea to stay on your team\'s side of the ring whenever possible, and only move past the middle when your allies are nearby.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNcMNBLLtF0/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNcMNBLLtF0?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNcMNBLLtF0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

 The lane starts at your Vain crystal and runs to the enemy Vain crystal.

### Minions

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i7EVv-Cy0o\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Team Minions\",\"description\":\"Minions spawn in waves near each team\'s Vain crystal. From here they\'ll march forward along the lane towards the enemy base, engaging in battle with the first enemies they see along the way.\n\nLike turrets, minions will change their target to an enemy hero if a nearby allied hero is under attack.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4i7EVv-Cy0o/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i7EVv-Cy0o?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i7EVv-Cy0o?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

**Minions** spawn from your Vain crystal. They are harmless to you and will attack enemy heroes and minions. These little soldiers move toward the enemy’s crystal down the lane. Meanwhile, minions will do the same from the opponent’s Vain. Killing enemy minions earns the player gold and experience.

### Turrets

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40a0DSavXM\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Team Turrets\",\"description\":\"Turrets are powerful defensive structures that provide each team a safe place to fall back to. It\'s necessary to take down these turrets before your team can destroy the enemy Vain crystal.\n\nThere are three basic rules to follow when attacking a turret:\n\nFirst, let your team\'s minions approach the turret before you. By default, turrets will attack any minions in range before they begin attacking heroes.\n\nSecond, fall back from the turret before your last minion dies. If there are no minions in range, turrets will begin attacking nearby heroes instead.\n\nFinally, don\'t attack enemy heroes under their own turret. Turrets will immediately attack you if you attack a hero that\'s under their protection.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J40a0DSavXM/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J40a0DSavXM?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J40a0DSavXM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

**Turrets **are the main feature of the lane. There are five turrets on your side, five on your opponent’s side. They are controlled by the AI and will defend their side of the map from enemies — minion and heroes alike. Turrets on your side of the map are friendly to you and your minions just as turrets on your opponent’s side are friendly to them and their minions. In order to destroy the enemy Vain crystal, you must defeat all of your enemy’s turrets. These must be destroyed in order, with the exception of the last two, which can be destroyed in any order. Destroying an enemy turret will earn everyone on your team 300 gold.

## The Jungle

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FofSinu4\_YA\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"The Jungle\",\"description\":\"The jungle is the largest area on the map, sitting between both bases and beneath the lane. This area allows for leveling outside of the lane and offers several strategic points of interest.\n\nEach half of the jungle contains four camps of neutral monsters. Additionally, minion mines sit at the east and west corners of the jungle. The gold miner appears at the center of the jungle, and is replaced by the Kraken later during the match.\n\nAdditionally, the jungle also contains a shop that can be used by players from either team.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FofSinu4\_YA/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FofSinu4\_YA?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FofSinu4\_YA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

The jungle is a comparatively larger and more complex area of the map. The jungle starts south of the lane’s brush and extends to the bottom of the map.

### The Item Shop

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

**The Item Shop **is located in the bottom of the map, surrounded by brush. Unlike the starting point item shop, this shop can be used by either team

### The Gold Miner

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCwi46cJHfU\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"The Gold Mine\",\"description\":\"The gold mine sits at the center of the jungle. Several minutes into the match, a miner spawns and begins collecting gold.\n\nThe dial on the mini-map allows you to keep track of how much gold has been collected. It\'s usually good to wait until this dial is more than halfway full before moving in to capture the mine.\n\nWhen you kill the miner, your team takes all of the gold the miner has currently collected, after which a new miner appears in its place and begins collecting gold again.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WCwi46cJHfU/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCwi46cJHfU?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCwi46cJHfU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

**The Gold Miner** mans the cave entrance directly below the midpoint of the lane. He only appears after 4 minutes have passed in the game. The Gold Miner is a monster that either team can kill to earn his gold. He’s a tough fighter, but won’t stray too far from his home. The team that last-hits the Miner is awarded his gold.

### The Kraken

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNCMkkGRn-g\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"The Kraken\",\"description\":\"15 minutes into the match the Kraken moves in and replaces the gold miner. The Kraken is difficult to capture and may require your full team. When defeated, Kraken will fight for your team and push down the enemy lane towards your enemy\'s base.\n\nIf the enemy team does manage to kill Kraken during the rampage, everyone on the enemy team will earn a large gold bounty.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pNCMkkGRn-g/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNCMkkGRn-g?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNCMkkGRn-g?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778}}" %}

**The Kraken** is a massive monster that replaces the Gold Miner on the map at the 15-minute mark. The Kraken requires a great deal of damage to defeat. Instead of getting gold as a reward, the team that last-hits the Kraken gets it to fight on that team’s side. The unleashed Kraken will attack the nearest turret of the enemy and will continue attacking enemy turrets until defeated or the enemy team’s Vain crystal has been destroyed.

### The Crystal Sentry

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28398%29.png)

**The Crystal Sentry** spawns, already affiliated with your team, from your Vain Crystal at the 4 minute mark and walks out to the Crystal Mine in your side of the Jungle. The Crystal Sentry is a protector in your Jungle, automatically targeting and attacking any enemy hero on sight. It travels a significant distance and deals significantly more damage to help you defend against enemy invasions.The bounty for killing a Crystal Sentry fairly significant at 125 gold, and you can gain some experience, but it is a tough fight. The Crystal Sentry only has 3 lives, after which it will no longer respawn after dying.

### The Treants

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28222%29.png)

**The Treants **are the single-monster camps in the jungle. Each treant not only gives the player a gold payout upon defeat, but will also heal over time the player that last-hit it. Targeting the healers is a great way to regenerate health in the jungle.

### The Backs

{% embed data="{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVbch-W\_n9Q\",\"type\":\"video\",\"title\":\"Jungle Monsters\",\"description\":\"Shortly after the match starts, camps of neutral monsters will appear throughout the jungle. Killing the monsters in these camps allows players on a team to earn gold and experience through the jungle instead of the lane.\n\nCamps with two monsters are a good source of gold. Camps with a single larger monster offer gold and also heal the player that deals the killing blow.\n\nJungle monsters reward more gold and experience the longer they\'ve been left alive.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVbch-W\_n9Q/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVbch-W\_n9Q?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVbch-W\_n9Q?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\" style=\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778},\"caption\":\"\*Note: Two of the \\"backs\\" monsters were replaced by Treants\"}" %}

**The “backs” **are the monsters located in the jungle section closest to each team’s starting point or the “back” part of the map. Defeating these monsters will get you the most gold of any jungle camps in the game. That is why the jungler and/or roam will try to target these as soon as they respawn. If the opportunity presents itself, defeating the enemy’s “backs” is a great aggressive tactic to get a lead on the war for gold — so important that it’s sometimes worth dying to get.

### The Front Doubles

**The “front doubles” **are the twin monsters who hang out by the minion mine closest to the middle section or “front” of the map. These two monsters give a medium amount of gold and are often part of a jungler’s path through the jungle.

## WELCOME TO THE HALCYON FOLD

In one way or another, each hero is here because of the Halcyon Well. This ancient energy source provides incredible power for both technology and magic. However, the well only releases this energy on rare occasions, and these heroes must fight for control if they want to capture the energy for themselves.

The stakes are too high to fight alone. Some heroes arrive with family or faction, while others form uneasy alliances. Together they forge three-person teams ready to meet their opponents in battle.
