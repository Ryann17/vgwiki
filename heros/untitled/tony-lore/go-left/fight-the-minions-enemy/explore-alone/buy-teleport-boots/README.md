# Buy Teleport Boots

“Teleport Boots. Definitely.”

You waste no time: after pulling them on, you stare at a rock a short distance away and… you appear on the head of a minion who’s busy peeing over the edge of the Rise. Teetering, wheeling your arms, you manage to fall backward into a brush.

_It worked!_ Your belly is gurgling and the boots are smoking, but it worked! You could go anywhere! Maybe somewhere warm. Or… you could find out what’s _really_ going on at the center of the mountain.
