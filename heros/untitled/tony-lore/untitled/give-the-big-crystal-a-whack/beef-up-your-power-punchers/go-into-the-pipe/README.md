# Go into the pipe

It doesn’t smell great in there, and it’s dark, but the ticket to your retirement is at the bottom of that pipe.

You feel around inside the opening until you find the ladder rungs and ease yourself inside. Slow and steady, feeling your way, you descend into the blackness.

A face appears at the pipe’s opening, and then another face. Odd little furry, curious faces.

“Uh-oh,” says one face.

“Uh-oh,” agrees the other.

Going into the pipe was not the best idea, but it’s too late. Oofing with effort, the two furry guys lift up the ladder and drop it – with you attached. The last thing you see, before all goes black, is a new crystal being lowered onto the pipe.

You freefall, slamming into the sides of the pipe with large _CLANGS_, yelling for your mom. With your arms and legs spread out wide, you manage to slow your fall. Sparks fly as the metal punchers _SCREEEEE_ against the metal pipe, and you stop, heaving for breath.
