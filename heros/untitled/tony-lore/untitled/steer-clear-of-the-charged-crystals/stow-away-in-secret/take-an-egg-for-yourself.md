# Take an egg for yourself

#### 'PRINCESS PINKERTON'

You pick up one of the eggs – careful with those power punchers! – and make your way to the cave’s bright entrance. Just in time, you duck away from a giant shadow passing over the peak. The flying figure cuts through a cloud. It can’t be, but it _is_. It’s a white dragon! With renewed awe, you stare at the egg in your arms. It’s pink and pretty… and it’s _yours_.

Avoiding the shadow, you hurry down the path and, after sunset, away from Mont Lille forever. You hide away in a wild forest where you make your home with your little dragon friend, Princess Pinkerton.
